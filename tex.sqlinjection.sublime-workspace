However, in the industry there is believed to be a lack of desire for another race to produce such a console. Reasons for this include the challenge and massive expense of creating consoles that are graphically superior to the current generation, with Sony and Microsoft still looking to recoup development costs on their current consoles and the failure of content creation tools to keep up with the increased demands placed upon the people creating the games.</p> <p>On June 14, 2010, during E3, Microsoft revealed their new Xbox 360 console referred to as the Xbox 360 S or Slim. Microsoft made the unit smaller and quieter, while also installing a 250GB hard drive and built-in 802.11n WiFi. It started shipping to US stores the same day, not reaching Europe until July 13.</p> <p>The Onlive cloud-based gaming system would be one of the first cloud gaming systems known in video game history.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gaming_without_controllers\">Gaming without controllers</span></h3> <p>On November 4, 2010, <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft\" title=\"Microsoft\">Microsoft</a> released <a href=\"/wiki/Kinect\" title=\"Kinect\">Kinect</a> in North America, and later in other parts of the world, as a peripheral for the Xbox 360; it was packaged with the console as well. It uses a sensor and dual-camera device to track the motion of the players themselves. It sold an average of 133,333 units a day for the first 60 days and a total of 8 million units during the same period, earning it the <a href=\"/wiki/Guinness_World_Records\" title=\"Guinness World Records\">Guinness World Record</a> for the \"fastest selling consumer electronics device\". Sales passed 10 million units as of March 9, 2011.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eighth_generation_consoles_.282011.E2.80.93present.29\">Eighth generation consoles (2011–present)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(eighth_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (eighth generation)\">History of video game consoles (eighth generation)</a></div> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_3DS\" title=\"Nintendo 3DS\">Nintendo 3DS</a> is a handheld video game console, revealed at Nintendo's 2010 E3 press conference. Released in Japan in February 2011, it was released worldwide less than a month later. It uses <a href=\"/wiki/Autostereoscopic\" title=\"Autostereoscopic\" class=\"mw-redirect\">autostereoscopic</a> 3D to produce a 3D effect on-screen.</p> <p>On January 27, 2011, the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Vita\" title=\"PlayStation Vita\">PlayStation Vita</a> (code-named Next Generation Portable, or NGP, during development) was announced. It has a 5-inch <a href=\"/wiki/OLED\" title=\"OLED\">OLED</a> multi touch front screen and a rear touch pad, two analog sticks, 3G and WiFi connection, Sixaxis control and 3-axis electronic compass. It was released on December 17 in Japan and has been released on 15th (First edition bundle) and on February 22 in Europe (3G/ Wifi Vita, release bundle Vita, or the WiFi only Vita), and also in the Middle East, Australia and North America. Sony is looking to have up to forty launch titles for the western release and up to 100 within the release window.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_U\" title=\"Wii U\">Wii U</a> is a video game console from <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo\" title=\"Nintendo\">Nintendo</a>. Billed as the successor to the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii\" title=\"Wii\">Wii</a>, it was mentioned in statement released by Nintendo on April 25, 2011, that the company was planning to reveal it during <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo\" title=\"Electronic Entertainment Expo\">E3 2011</a> and that playable console units would be present as well. Code-named <i>Project Café</i>, it was officially introduced on June 7, 2011 with its final name, Wii U. The console released in North America on November 18, and in Europe, Australia and New Zealand on November 30, 2012, officially starting the \"eighth generation\" of video game consoles. Features of the new console include <a href=\"/wiki/High-definition_video\" title=\"High-definition video\">HD</a> graphics support (on Wii U only), and a controller, the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_U_GamePad\" title=\"Wii U GamePad\">Wii U GamePad</a>, which features a 6.2&nbsp;inch touch screen built-in that can be used as a <a href=\"/wiki/Second_screen\" title=\"Second screen\">second screen</a> providing additional info and interactivity, such as \"asymmetric gameplay\". The Wii U GamePad allows some games to be played without the need of a TV set, through <a href=\"/wiki/Off-TV_Play\" title=\"Off-TV Play\">Off-TV Play</a>. Most peripheral hardware from its predecessor, the Wii, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Remote\" title=\"Wii Remote\">Wii Remote</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Nunchuk\" title=\"Wii Nunchuk\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Wii Nunchuk</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Classic_Controller\" title=\"Classic Controller\">Classic Controller</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Balance_Board\" title=\"Wii Balance Board\">Wii Balance Board</a> are confirmed to work with the new console, as well as the console itself being <a href=\"/wiki/Backward_compatibility\" title=\"Backward compatibility\">backward compatible</a> with all Wii and <a href=\"/wiki/Virtual_Console\" title=\"Virtual Console\">Virtual Console</a> titles. The Wii U discontinues backwards-compatibility support for <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_GameCube\" title=\"Nintendo GameCube\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Nintendo GameCube</a> discs and controllers, which also means that Wii games that support the GameCube's controller will instead require use of an alternate control scheme such as the Classic Controller when playing them on the Wii U. The Wii U also has its own more conventional controller, the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_U_Pro_Controller\" title=\"Wii U Pro Controller\">Wii U Pro Controller</a>, which resembles an Xbox 360 controller in form and function and is compatible with most Wii U and Virtual Console titles, but not original Wii games. The console is available in two sets. The basic set includes the Wii U console with 8 GB of internal memory, the Wii U GamePad, an AC adapter, an HDMI cable, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Sensor_Bar\" title=\"Wii Sensor Bar\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Wii Sensor Bar</a>. The Deluxe set includes all of the items in the basic set but it has 32 GB of internal memory instead of only 8 GB, and is bundled with a GamePad charging cradle, stands for the GamePad and the console, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_Land\" title=\"Nintendo Land\">Nintendo Land</a></i>. On November 30, 2012, the Wii U was released in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. A sensor bar is not included in the Basic set in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_4\" title=\"PlayStation 4\">PlayStation 4</a> (or PS4) is a video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment. Billed as the successor to the PlayStation 3, the PlayStation 4 was officially announced at a press conference on February 20, 2013. The fourth home console in Sony's PlayStation series, it was launched on 15-November-2013 in North America and 29-November-2013 in Europe, and is set to launch Q1 2014 in Japan. Moving away from the Cell architecture, the PlayStation 4 is the first in the Sony series to feature compatibility with the x86 architecture, specifically x86-64, which is a widely used platform common in many modern PCs. The idea is to make video game development easier on the next-generation console, attracting a broader range of developers large and small. These changes highlight Sony's effort to improve upon the lessons learned during the development, production and release of the PS3. Other notable hardware features of the PlayStation 4 include 8 GB of GDDR5 RAM memory and a faster Blu-ray drive.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Xbox_One\" title=\"Xbox One\">Xbox One</a> is a video game console from Microsoft. Billed as the successor to the Xbox 360, the Xbox One was officially announced at a press conference on May 21, 2013. Microsoft had intended to implement strict controls over game resale and DRM controls, but later reversed its decision due to public backlash. It is the third home console in Microsoft's Xbox series and launched on November 22, 2013 in North America, United Kingdom, Spain, Mexico, Italy, Ireland, Germany, France, Canada, Brazil, Austria, New Zealand and Australia. The release was delayed until sometime in 2014 in 8 European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland) due to various localization issues.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_future\">The future</span></h3> <p>In 2014 the <a href=\"/wiki/New_3",
			"ng many now-classic gaming franchises such as Halo, Grand Theft Auto and Resident Evil, the latter two of which were notable for both their success and notoriety. Even Nintendo, widely known for its aversion to adult content (with very few exceptions, most notably <i><a href=\"/wiki/Conker%27s_Bad_Fur_Day\" title=\"Conker's Bad Fur Day\">Conker's Bad Fur Day</a></i> for the <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_64\" title=\"Nintendo 64\">Nintendo 64</a>), began publishing more M-rated games, with Silicon Knights's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Eternal_Darkness:_Sanity%27s_Requiem\" title=\"Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem</a></i> and Capcom's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil_4\" title=\"Resident Evil 4\">Resident Evil 4</a></i> being prime examples. This trend in \"hardcore\" console gaming would partially be reversed with the seventh generation of consoles and their focus on motion-based gameplay, leading to more family-friendly titles.</p> <p>In January 2013, Sony announced that the PlayStation 2 had been discontinued worldwide, ending the sixth generation.</p> <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Return_of_alternative_controllers\">Return of alternative controllers</span></h4> <p>One significant feature of this generation was various manufacturers' renewed fondness for add-on peripheral controllers. While alternative controllers weren't new (Nintendo supported several for the NES and PC games have long supported driving wheels and aircraft joysticks), console games built around them became some of the biggest hits of the decade. Konami sold a soft-plastic mat version of its foot controls for its <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution\" title=\"Dance Dance Revolution\">Dance Dance Revolution</a></i> franchise in 1998. Sega came out with <a href=\"/wiki/Samba_de_Amigo\" title=\"Samba de Amigo\">Samba de Amigo</a>'s maraca controllers. Nintendo's <a href=\"/wiki/DK_Bongos\" title=\"DK Bongos\">bongo controller</a> worked with a few games in its <i><a href=\"/wiki/Donkey_Kong\" title=\"Donkey Kong\">Donkey Kong</a></i> franchise. Publisher <a href=\"/wiki/RedOctane\" title=\"RedOctane\">RedOctane</a> introduced <i><a href=\"/wiki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> and its distinctive guitar-shaped controllers for the PlayStation 2. Meanwhile, Sony developed the <a href=\"/wiki/EyeToy\" title=\"EyeToy\">EyeToy</a> peripheral, a camera that could detect player movement, for the PlayStation 2. This would further be developed into whole-body tracking technologies such as Sony's PlayStation Move and Microsoft's Kinect.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Online_gaming_rises_to_prominence\">Online gaming rises to prominence</span></h3> <p>As affordable broadband Internet connectivity spread, many publishers turned to online gaming as a way of innovating. <a href=\"/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game\" title=\"Massively multiplayer online role-playing game\">Massively multiplayer online role-playing games</a> (MMORPGs) featured significant titles for the PC market like <i><a href=\"/wiki/RuneScape\" title=\"RuneScape\">RuneScape</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/World_of_Warcraft\" title=\"World of Warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/EverQuest\" title=\"EverQuest\">EverQuest</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ultima_Online\" title=\"Ultima Online\">Ultima Online</a></i>. Historically, console-based MMORPGs have been few in number due to the lack of bundled Internet connectivity options for the platforms. This made it hard to establish a large enough subscription community to justify the development costs. The first significant console MMORPGs were <i><a href=\"/wiki/Phantasy_Star_Online\" title=\"Phantasy Star Online\">Phantasy Star Online</a></i> on the Sega <a href=\"/wiki/Dreamcast\" title=\"Dreamcast\">Dreamcast</a> (which had a built in modem and aftermarket Ethernet adapter), followed by <i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Fantasy_XI\" title=\"Final Fantasy XI\">Final Fantasy XI</a></i> for the Sony <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_2\" title=\"PlayStation 2\">PlayStation 2</a> (an aftermarket Ethernet adapter was shipped to support this game). Every major platform released since the Dreamcast has either been bundled with the ability to support an Internet connection or has had the option available as an aftermarket add-on. Microsoft's Xbox also had its own online gaming service called <a href=\"/wiki/Xbox_Live\" title=\"Xbox Live\">Xbox Live</a>. Xbox Live was a huge success and proved to be a driving force for the Xbox with games like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Halo_2\" title=\"Halo 2\">Halo 2</a></i> that were overwhelmingly popular.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mobile_games\">Mobile games</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_game\" title=\"Mobile game\">Mobile game</a></div> <p>In the early 2000s (decade), mobile games had gained mainstream popularity in <a href=\"/wiki/Japanese_mobile_phone_culture\" title=\"Japanese mobile phone culture\">Japan's mobile phone culture</a>, years before the United States or Europe. By 2003, a wide variety of mobile games were available on Japanese phones, ranging from <a href=\"/wiki/Puzzle_video_game\" title=\"Puzzle video game\">puzzle games</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Digital_pet\" title=\"Digital pet\">virtual pet</a> titles that utilize <a href=\"/wiki/Camera_phone\" title=\"Camera phone\">camera phone</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Fingerprint_recognition\" title=\"Fingerprint recognition\">fingerprint scanner</a> technologies to <a href=\"/wiki/3D_computer_graphics\" title=\"3D computer graphics\">3D</a> games with <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_(console)\" title=\"PlayStation (console)\">PlayStation</a>-quality graphics. Older <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade-style games</a> became particularly popular on mobile phones, which were an ideal platform for arcade-style games designed for shorter play sessions. Namco began making attempts to introduce mobile gaming culture to Europe in 2003.</p> <p>Mobile gaming interest was raised when Nokia launched its <a href=\"/wiki/N-Gage_(device)\" title=\"N-Gage (device)\">N-Gage</a> phone and handheld gaming platform in 2003. While about two million handsets were sold, the product line wasn't seen as a success and was withdrawn from Nokia's lineup. Meanwhile, many game developers had noticed that more advanced phones had color screens and enough memory and processing power to do reasonable gaming. Mobile phone gaming revenues passed 1 billion dollars in 2003, and passed 5 billion dollars in 2007, accounting for a quarter of all videogaming software revenues. More advanced phones came to the market such as the N-Series <a href=\"/wiki/Smartphone\" title=\"Smartphone\">smartphone</a> by Nokia in 2005 and the <a href=\"/wiki/IPhone\" title=\"IPhone\">iPhone</a> by Apple in 2007 which strongly added to the appeal of mobile phone gaming. In 2008 Nokia didn't revise the N-Gage brand, but published a software library of games to its top-end phones. At Apple's App Store in 2008, more than half of all applications sold were iPhone games.</p> <p>Due to the debut of app stores created by Apple and Google (Android), plus the low-cost retail price of downloadable phone apps, games available on smartphones increasingly rival the video game console market. The most famous mobile game app is Angry Birds, which was released in 2009 and by the year after reached 2 million downloads. Even Nintendo announced their intentions for developing more games and content for mobile devices. Sega company is also dedicating development resources toward creating more mobile games. Independent small developers are also entering the game market by creating mobile games and hoping that they will gain popularity with smartphone gaming enthusiasts.</p> <p>Besides Angry Birds, some of the most popular mobile games include:</p> <ul> <li>Bejeweled</li> <li>Flappy Bird</li> <li>Minecraft</li> <li>Candy Crush</li> <li>Clash of Clans</li> <li>Fruit Ninja</li> <li>Robot Unicorn</li> <li>Temple Run</li> </ul> <p>·Temple Run 2</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Seventh_generation_consoles_.282004.E2.80.93present.29\">Seventh generation consoles (2004–present)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(seventh_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (seventh generation)\">History of video game consoles (seventh generation)</a></div> <p>The generation opened early for handheld consoles, as Nintendo introduced their <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_DS\" title=\"Nintendo DS\">Nintendo DS</a> and Sony premiered the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Portable\" title=\"PlayStation Portable\">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP) within a month of each other in 2004. While the PSP boasted superior graphics and power, following a trend established since the mid-1980s, Nintendo gambled on a lower-power design but featuring a novel control interface. The DS's two screens, one of which was touch-sensitive, proved extremely popular with consumers, especially young children and middle-aged gamers, who were drawn to the device by Nintendo's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nintendogs\" title=\"Nintendogs\">Nintendogs</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Brain_Age:_Train_Your_Brain_in_Minutes_a_Day!\" title=\"Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!\">Brain Age</a></i> series, respectively. While the PSP attracted a significant portion of veteran gamers, the DS allowed Nintendo to continue its dominance in handheld gaming. Nintendo updated their line with the <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_DS_Lite\" title=\"Nintendo DS Lite\">Nintendo DS Lite</a> in 2006, the <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_DSi\" title=\"Nintendo DSi\">Nintendo DSi</a> in 2008 (Japan) and 2009 (Americas and Europe), and the Nintendo DSi XL while Sony updated the PSP in 2007 and again with the smaller <a href=\"/wiki/PSP_Go\" title=\"PSP Go\">PSP Go</a> in 2009. Nokia withdrew their <a href=\"/wiki/N-Gage_(device)\" title=\"N-Gage (device)\">N-Gage</a> platform in 2005 but reintroduced the brand as a game-oriented service for high-end smartphones on April 3, 2008.</p> <p>In console gaming, Microsoft stepped forward first in November 2005 with the <a href=\"/wiki/Xbox_360\" title=\"Xbox 360\">Xbox 360</a>, and Sony followed in 2006 with the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_3\" title=\"PlayStation 3\">PlayStation 3</a>, released in Europe in March 2007. Setting the technology standard for the generation, both featured high-definition graphics over HDMI connections, large hard disk-based secondary storage for save games and downloaded content, integrated networking, and a companion on-line gameplay and sales platform, with Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, respectively. Both were formidable systems that were the first to challenge personal computers in power (at launch) while offering a relatively modest price compared to them. While both were more expensive than most past consoles, the Xbox 360 enjoyed a substantial price edge, selling for either $300 or $400 depending on model, while the PS3 launched with models priced at $500 and $600. Coming with <a href=\"/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc\" title=\"Blu-ray Disc\">Blu-ray Disc</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Wi-Fi\" title=\"Wi-Fi\">Wi-Fi</a>, the PlayStation 3 was the most expensive game console on the market since Panasonic's version of the 3DO, which retailed for little under $700. The PlayStation 3's high price led to the console being defeated by the Xbox 360 (also resulting in Xbox 360 gaining market leadership until 2008), thus breaking the streak of dominance that the PlayStation brand once had, which was started in 1994 with the success of the original PlayStation. However, the slim model and the PlayStation Move controllers caused a massive recovery for PlayStation 3, and the console would soon outsell Xbox 360 by 2013.</p> <p>In this generation, Nintendo not only secured its dominance in the handheld video game market, but also successfully regained total dominance on both the home video game market and the entire video game industry with the release of its home console, the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii\" title=\"Wii\">Wii</a>. While the Wii had lower technical specifications than both the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, only a modest improvement over the GameCube and the only 7th-gen console not to offer HD graphics, its new motion control was much touted, and its lower pricepoint of around $200–$250 appealed to budget-conscious households. Many gamers, publishers, and analysts initially dismissed the Wii as an underpowered curiosity, but were surprised as the console sold out through the 2006 Christmas season, and remained so through the next 18 months, becoming the fastest selling game console in most of the world's gaming markets. As a result, the Wii became a global success, having outsold the Xbox 360 and relegated PlayStation 3 to third place, thus making the Wii the first Nintendo console to outsell a PlayStation console, and the runaway market leader of the seventh generate of consoles. As of September 2013, the Wii has sold 100.3 million units worldwide and is currently Nintendo's best selling home console. Also, the Wii became the first Nintendo console to have its number of units sold reach 100 million.</p> <p>The Wii's major strength was its appeal to audiences beyond the base of \"hardcore gamers\", with its novel motion-sensing, pointer-based controller design allowing players to use the Wii Remote as if it were a golf club, tennis racket, baseball, sword, or steering wheel. The intuitive pointer-based navigation was reminiscent of the familiar PC mouse control, making the console easier for new players to use than a conventional gamepad. The console launched with a variety of first-party titles meant to showcase what the system could do, including the commonly bundled <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Sports\" title=\"Wii Sports\">Wii Sports</a></i>, the party game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Play\" title=\"Wii Play\">Wii Play</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess\" title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess\">The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess</a></i> which received widespread critical acclaim for its art, story and gameplay, including its intuitive sword-and-shield use of the motion-sensing controllers. Third-party support, on the other hand, was slower in coming; game designers, used to the conventional gamepad control sets, had difficulty adapting popular franchises to the heavily motion-based Wii controller, and some didn't bother, preferring instead to concentrate on what they felt to be their core audience on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Of the top 15 <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_best-selling_Wii_video_games\" title=\"List of best-selling Wii video games\">best-selling games for Wii</a>, 12 were developed by Nintendo's in-house EAD groups.</p> <p>In June 2009, Sony announced that it would release its <a href=\"/wiki/PSP_Go\" title=\"PSP Go\">PSP Go</a> for US$249.99 on October 1 in Europe and North America, and Japan on November 1. The PSP Go was a newer, slimmer version of the PSP, which had the control pad slide from the base, where its screen covers most of the front side.</p> <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Increases_in_development_budgets\">Increases in development budgets</span></h4> <p>With high-definition video an undeniable hit with veteran gamers seeking immersive experiences, expectations for visuals in games along with the increasing complexity of productions resulted in a spike in the development budgets of gaming companies. While some game studios saw their Xbox 360 projects pay off, the unexpected weakness of PS3 sales resulted in heavy losses for a few developers, and many publishers broke previously arranged PS3 exclusivity arrangements or cancelled PS3 game projects entirely due to rising budgets.</p> <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nintendo_capitalizes_on_casual_gaming\">Nintendo capitalizes on casual gaming</span></h4> <p>Meanwhile, Nintendo took cues from PC gaming and their own success with the Nintendo Wii, and crafted games that capitalized on the intuitive nature of motion control. Emphasis on gameplay turned comparatively simple games into unlikely runaway hits, including the bundled game, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Sports\" title=\"Wii Sports\">Wii Sports</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Fit\" title=\"Wii Fit\">Wii Fit</a></i>. As Wii sales spiked, many publishers were caught unprepared and responded by assembling hastily created titles to fill the void. Although some hardcore games continued to be produced by Nintendo, many of their classic franchises were reworked into \"bridge games\", meant to provide new gamers crossover experiences from casual gaming to deeper experiences, including their flagship Wii title, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Super_Mario_Galaxy\" title=\"Super Mario Galaxy\">Super Mario Galaxy</a></i>, which in spite of its standard-resolution graphics dominated critics' \"best-of\" lists for 2007. Many others, however, strongly criticized Nintendo for its apparent spurning of its core gamer base in favor of a demographic many warned would be fickle and difficult to keep engaged.</p> <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Motion_control_revolutionizes_game_play\">Motion control revolutionizes game play</span></h4> <p>The way gamers interact with games changed dramatically, especially with Nintendo's wholesale embrace of motion control as a standard method of interaction. The <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Remote\" title=\"Wii Remote\">Wii Remote</a> implemented the principles to be a worldwide success. To a lesser extent, Sony experimented with motion in its <a href=\"/wiki/Sixaxis\" title=\"Sixaxis\">Sixaxis</a> and subsequent <a href=\"/wiki/DualShock\" title=\"DualShock\">DualShock</a> 3 controller for the PS3, and a wave of titles supporting the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Eye\" title=\"PlayStation Eye\">PlayStation Eye</a> camera and the Wii-like <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Move\" title=\"PlayStation Move\">PlayStation Move</a> remote wands, while Microsoft continually mentioned interest in developing the technology for the Xbox 360, ultimately resulting in the <a href=\"/wiki/Kinect\" title=\"Kinect\">Kinect</a> peripheral for their Xbox 360. The Wii's infrared-based pointing system has been widely praised, and cited as a primary reason for the success of games such as Nintendo's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption\" title=\"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption\">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a></i> and EA's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Medal_of_Honor:_Heroes_2\" title=\"Medal of Honor: Heroes 2\">Medal of Honor: Heroes 2</a></i>. Despite the success of these titles, reliable motion controls have been more elusive, with even the most refined motion controls failing to achieve true 1-to-1 reproduction of player motion on-screen. Some players have even found that they must move slower than they would like or the Wii will not register their movements, but this is rare. Nintendo's 2008 announcement of its <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_MotionPlus\" title=\"Wii MotionPlus\">Wii MotionPlus</a> module largely addressed these concerns by adding extra gyroscopic sensors to achieve true 1:1 attitude tracking of the Wii Remote, which when coupled with assumptions made about how the player is holding the controller allows for relatively accurate position tracking. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Sports_Resort\" title=\"Wii Sports Resort\">Wii Sports Resort</a></i> launched alongside the new MotionPlus add-on as a showcase of its abilities, and many games since, including <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Skyward_Sword\" title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword\">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a></i> have used it. The MotionPlus technology has since been integrated into new Wii Remotes, avoiding the extra length and custom protective sleeve that the add-on module requires.</p> <p>The introduction of motion-sensing controllers has caused an uptick in repetitive motion injuries normally seen in athletes, such as \"Wii elbow\", a derivative of tennis elbow linked to motion-sensing controller use. Most of these injuries are minor aches or pains and create no lasting effect. More seriously, the use of motions such as throwing while holding the controller have also caused issues, as some players have reportedly actually thrown the controller at the TV, resulting in significant damage to both. Injuries and damage from flailing arms and legs while playing are also reported. Nintendo foresaw these possible issues, and each Wii Remote ships with a wrist strap tether and a silicone rubber sleeve to prevent flying remotes and damage on impact, and the Wii System Menu includes screens prior to game startup reminding players to use these, and to make sure breakable objects and other players are out of reach. Some reports of damage surfaced soon after launch stating that the wrist straps were breaking due to a thin cord being used to tether the strap to the remote; Nintendo responded in December 2006 with an upgraded wrist strap with thicker tether cord, which was standard on all Wii Remotes sold after January 1, 2007 and available as a free replacement for all Wii consoles shipped prior to that date.</p> <p>Alternate controllers also continue to be important in gaming, as the increasingly involved controllers associated with Red Octane's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a></i> series and Harmonix's <i>Rock Band</i> demonstrate. In addition to this, Nintendo has produced various add-on attachments meant to adapt the Wii Remote to specific games, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Zapper\" title=\"Wii Zapper\">Wii Zapper</a> for shooting games and the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Wheel\" title=\"Wii Wheel\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Wii Wheel</a> for driving games. With the introduction of the <a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Balance_Board\" title=\"Wii Balance Board\">Wii Balance Board</a> in Nintendo's <i><a href=\"/wiki/Wii_Fit\" title=\"Wii Fit\">Wii Fit</a></i> package, motion controls have been extended to players' feet. The Balance Board has been supported by <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_games_that_support_Wii_Balance_Board\" title=\"List of games that support Wii Balance Board\">dozens of games</a> since its introduction.</p> <p>At <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Entertainment_Expo_2009\" title=\"Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009\">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft\" title=\"Microsoft\">Microsoft</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment\" title=\"Sony Computer Entertainment\">Sony</a> each presented their own new motion controllers: Project Natal (later renamed <i><a href=\"/wiki/Kinect\" title=\"Kinect\">Kinect</a></i>) and <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Move\" title=\"PlayStation Move\">PlayStation Move</a>, respectively.</p> <p>On September 17, 2010, <a href=\"/wiki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a> released <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Move\" title=\"PlayStation Move\">PlayStation Move</a>, which uses the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Eye\" title=\"PlayStation Eye\">PlayStation Eye</a> camera to track the motion of a wand controller, <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Move\" title=\"PlayStation Move\">PlayStation Move</a> has sold 8.8 million units as of E3 2011.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Rise_of_casual_PC_games\">Rise of casual PC games</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Casual_game\" title=\"Casual game\">Casual game</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Social_network_game\" title=\"Social network game\">Social network game</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_game\" title=\"Mobile game\">Mobile game</a></div> <p>Beginning with PCs, a new trend in <a href=\"/wiki/Casual_game\" title=\"Casual game\">casual gaming</a>, games with limited complexity that were designed for shortened or impromptu play sessions, began to draw attention from the industry.

Nintendo responded with its own next generation system known as the <a href=\"/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System\" title=\"Super Nintendo Entertainment System\">Super NES</a> (SNES) in 1990. The <a href=\"/wiki/TurboGrafx-16\" title=\"TurboGrafx-16\">TurboGrafx-16</a> (1987) debuted early on alongside the Genesis, but unlike in Japan it did not achieve a large following in the USA due to a limited library of games and excessive distribution restrictions imposed by Hudson.</p> <p>The intense competition of this time was also a period of not entirely truthful marketing. The TurboGrafx-16 was billed as the first 16-bit system but its central processor was an 8-bit <a href=\"/wiki/Hudson_Soft_HuC6280\" title=\"Hudson Soft HuC6280\">HuC6280</a>, with only its <a href=\"/wiki/Hudson_Soft_HuC6270\" title=\"Hudson Soft HuC6270\">HuC6270</a> graphics processor being a true 16-bit chip. Additionally, the much earlier Mattel <a href=\"/wiki/Intellivision\" title=\"Intellivision\">Intellivision</a> contained a 16-bit processor. Sega, too, was known to stretch the truth in its marketing approach; they used the term \"Blast Processing\" to describe the simple fact that their console's CPU ran at a higher clock speed than that of the SNES (7.67 <a href=\"/wiki/Hertz\" title=\"Hertz\">MHz</a> vs 3.58&nbsp;MHz).</p> <p>In Japan, the 1987 success of the PC Engine (as the TurboGrafx-16 was known there) against the <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System\" title=\"Nintendo Entertainment System\">Famicom</a> and CD drive peripheral allowed it to fend off the Mega Drive (Genesis) in 1988, which never really caught on to the same degree as outside Japan. The PC Engine eventually lost out to the <a href=\"/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System\" title=\"Super Nintendo Entertainment System\">Super Famicom</a>, but, due to its popular CD add-ons, retained enough of a user base to support new games well into the late 1990s.</p> <p>CD-ROM drives were first seen in this generation, as add-ons for the PC Engine in 1988 and the Mega Drive in 1991. Nintendo experimented with optical media formats for the SNES in a joint venture with Sony, who would go on to develop this concept into the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_(console)\" title=\"PlayStation (console)\">PlayStation</a> and rise to prominence as a major competitor to Nintendo and Sega. Basic <a href=\"/wiki/3D_computer_graphics\" title=\"3D computer graphics\">3D graphics</a> entered the mainstream with <a href=\"/wiki/Flat_shading\" title=\"Flat shading\" class=\"mw-redirect\">flat-shaded</a> polygons enabled by additional processors in game cartridges like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Virtua_Racing\" title=\"Virtua Racing\">Virtua Racing</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Fox_(series)\" title=\"Star Fox (series)\">Star Fox</a></i>, and occasionally without special processors, as with <a href=\"/wiki/Mega_Drive\" title=\"Mega Drive\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Mega Drive/Genesis</a> games such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Cruiser\" title=\"Star Cruiser\">Star Cruiser</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hard_Drivin%27\" title=\"Hard Drivin'\">Hard Drivin'</a></i>, which managed pure 3D polygon graphics on the ~8&nbsp;MHz 68000 chip by using extremely simplified polygon models, a slow frame rate (&lt;4 fps), and reduced resolution.</p> <p>In 1991, the game and character <a href=\"/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(1991_video_game)\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)\">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> was introduced. The game gave Sega's <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Genesis\" title=\"Sega Genesis\">Mega Drive/Genesis</a> console mainstream popularity, and rivaled Nintendo's <a href=\"/wiki/Mario_(franchise)\" title=\"Mario (franchise)\">Mario</a> franchise. Its <a href=\"/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)\" title=\"Sonic the Hedgehog (character)\">namesake character</a> became the mascot of Sega and one of the most recognizable video game characters in history.</p> <p><a href=\"/wiki/SNK_Playmore\" title=\"SNK Playmore\">SNK</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Neo_Geo_(system)\" title=\"Neo Geo (system)\">Neo-Geo</a> was the most expensive console by a wide margin when it was released in 1990, and would remain so for years. It was also capable of 2D graphics in a quality level years ahead of other consoles. The reason for this was that it contained the same hardware that was found in SNK's arcade games. This was the first time since the home Pong machines that a true-to-the-arcade experience could be had at home.</p> <p>This generation ended with the SNES's discontinuation in 1999.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PC_gaming\">PC gaming</span></h3> <p>The increasing computing power and decreasing cost of processors such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Intel_80386\" title=\"Intel 80386\">Intel 80386</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Intel_80486\" title=\"Intel 80486\">Intel 80486</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Motorola_68030\" title=\"Motorola 68030\">Motorola 68030</a>, caused the rise of <a href=\"/wiki/3D_computer_graphics\" title=\"3D computer graphics\">3D graphics</a>, as well as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Multimedia\" title=\"Multimedia\">multimedia</a>\" capabilities through <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_card\" title=\"Sound card\">sound cards</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/CD-ROM\" title=\"CD-ROM\">CD-ROMs</a>.

Before the end of the decade, the evolution of the genre continued through \"<a href=\"/wiki/Graphical_MUD\" title=\"Graphical MUD\" class=\"mw-redirect\">graphical MUDs</a>\" into the first MMORPGs (<a href=\"/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game\" title=\"Massively multiplayer online role-playing game\">Massively multiplayer online role-playing games</a>), such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ultima_Online\" title=\"Ultima Online\">Ultima Online</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/EverQuest\" title=\"EverQuest\">EverQuest</a></i>, which freed users from the limited number of simultaneous players in other games and brought <a href=\"/wiki/Persistent_world\" title=\"Persistent world\">persistent worlds</a> to the mass market. A prime example of an MMORPG MUD is the game <a href=\"/wiki/RuneScape\" title=\"RuneScape\">RuneScape</a> created by Jagex.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, <a href=\"/wiki/Shareware\" title=\"Shareware\">shareware</a> distribution was a popular method of publishing games for smaller developers, including then-fledgling companies such as Apogee (now <a href=\"/wiki/3D_Realms\" title=\"3D Realms\">3D Realms</a>), Epic Megagames (now <a href=\"/wiki/Epic_Games\" title=\"Epic Games\">Epic Games</a>), and <a href=\"/wiki/Id_Software\" title=\"Id Software\">id Software</a>. It gave consumers the chance to try a trial portion of the game, usually restricted to the game’s complete first section or \"episode\", before purchasing the rest of the adventure. Racks of games on single 5<span class=\"frac nowrap\"><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></span>\" and later 3.5\" <a href=\"/wiki/Floppy_disk\" title=\"Floppy disk\">floppy disks</a> were common in many stores, often only costing a few dollars each. Since the shareware versions were essentially free, the cost only needed to cover the disk and minimal packaging. As the increasing size of games in the mid-1990s made them impractical to fit on floppies, and retail publishers and developers began to earnestly mimic the practice, shareware games were replaced by shorter <a href=\"/wiki/Game_demo\" title=\"Game demo\">game demos</a> (often only one or two levels), distributed free on CDs with gaming magazines and over the Internet.</p> <p>In 1992 the game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dune_II\" title=\"Dune II\">Dune II</a></i> was released. It was by no means the first in the genre (several other games can be called the first <a href=\"/wiki/Real-time_strategy\" title=\"Real-time strategy\">real-time strategy</a> game, see the <a href=\"/wiki/Real-time_strategy#History\" title=\"Real-time strategy\">History of RTS</a>), but it set the standard game mechanics for later blockbuster RTS games such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Warcraft:_Orcs_%26_Humans\" title=\"Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans\">Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer\" title=\"Command &amp; Conquer\">Command &amp; Conquer</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/StarCraft\" title=\"StarCraft\">StarCraft</a></i>. The RTS is characterized by an overhead view, a \"mini-map\", and the control of both the economic and military aspects of an army. The rivalry between the two styles of RTS play—<i>Warcraft</i> style, which used <a href=\"/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\" title=\"Graphical user interface\">GUIs</a> accessed once a production building was selected, and <i>C&amp;C</i> style, which allowed construction of any unit available from any production building from within a permanently visible menu—continues to the present day, with the Warcraft-style gaining prominence in other franchises such as <a href=\"/wiki/Homeworld\" title=\"Homeworld\">Homeworld</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Age_of_Empires\" title=\"Age of Empires\">Age of Empires</a>.</p> <p><i><a href=\"/wiki/Alone_in_the_Dark_(video_game)\" title=\"Alone in the Dark (video game)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Alone in the Dark</a></i> (1992), while not the first <a href=\"/wiki/Survival_horror\" title=\"Survival horror\">survival horror</a> game, planted the seeds of what would become known as the survival horror genre today. It took the <a href=\"/wiki/Action-adventure_game\" title=\"Action-adventure game\">action-adventure</a> style and retooled it to de-emphasize combat and focus on investigation. An early attempt to simulate 3D scenarios by mixing polygons with 2D background images, it established the formula that would later flourish on CD-ROM–based consoles, with games such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil_(1996_video_game)\" title=\"Resident Evil (1996 video game)\">Resident Evil</a></i>, which coined the name \"survival horror\" and popularized the genre, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Silent_Hill_(video_game)\" title=\"Silent Hill (video game)\">Silent Hill</a></i>.</p> <p>Adventure games continued to evolve, with <a href=\"/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment\" title=\"Sierra Entertainment\">Sierra Entertainment</a>’s <i><a href=\"/wiki/King%27s_Quest\" title=\"King's Quest\">King's Quest</a></i> series (which spawned the adult-humor <i><a href=\"/wiki/Leisure_Suit_Larry\" title=\"Leisure Suit Larry\">Leisure Suit Larry</a></i> franchise by the same publisher), and <a href=\"/wiki/Lucasfilm\" title=\"Lucasfilm\">Lucasfilm</a>/<a href=\"/wiki/LucasArts\" title=\"LucasArts\">LucasArts</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/Monkey_Island_(series)\" title=\"Monkey Island (series)\">Monkey Island</a></i> series bringing graphical interaction and the creation of the concept of \"point and click\" gaming. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Myst\" title=\"Myst\">Myst</a></i> and its sequels inspired a new style of puzzle-based adventure games. Published in 1993, <i>Myst</i> itself was one of the first computer games to make full use of the new high-capacity <a href=\"/wiki/CD-ROM\" title=\"CD-ROM\">CD-ROM</a> storage format. Despite <i>Myst</i>’s mainstream success, the increased popularity of action-based and real-time games led adventure games and <a href=\"/wiki/Simulation_video_game\" title=\"Simulation video game\">simulation video games</a>, both mainstays of computer games in earlier decades, to begin to fade into obscurity.</p> <p>It was in the 1990s that <a href=\"/wiki/Maxis\" title=\"Maxis\">Maxis</a> began publishing its successful <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_Sim_video_games\" title=\"List of Sim video games\">line of \"Sim\" games</a>, beginning with <i><a href=\"/wiki/SimCity_(1989_video_game)\" title=\"SimCity (1989 video game)\">SimCity</a></i>, and continuing with a variety of titles, such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/SimEarth\" title=\"SimEarth\">SimEarth</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/SimCity_2000\" title=\"SimCity 2000\">SimCity 2000</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/SimAnt\" title=\"SimAnt\">SimAnt</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/SimTower\" title=\"SimTower\">SimTower</a></i>, as well the <a href=\"/wiki/Strategy_game\" title=\"Strategy game\">strategic</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Life_simulation_game\" title=\"Life simulation game\">life-simulation</a> series, <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Sims\" title=\"The Sims\">The Sims</a></i>, which was first released in early 2000.</p> <p>In 1996, <a href=\"/wiki/3dfx_Interactive\" title=\"3dfx Interactive\">3dfx Interactive</a> released the Voodoo chipset, leading to the first affordable <a href=\"/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit\" title=\"Graphics processing unit\">3D accelerator cards</a> for personal computers. These devoted 3D rendering <a href=\"/wiki/Daughterboard\" title=\"Daughterboard\">daughterboards</a> performed a portion of the computations and memory-handling required for more-detailed three-dimensional graphics (mainly texture filtering), allowing for more-detailed graphics than would be possible if the CPU were required to handle both game logic and all the graphical tasks. First-person shooter games (notably <i><a href=\"/wiki/Quake_(video_game)\" title=\"Quake (video game)\">Quake</a></i>) were among the first to take advantage of this new technology. While other games would also make use of it, the FPS would become the chief driving force behind the development of new 3D hardware, as well as the yardstick by which its performance would be measured, usually quantified as the number of frames per second rendered for a particular scene in a particular game.</p> <p>Several other less mainstream genres were created in this decade. <a href=\"/wiki/Looking_Glass_Studios\" title=\"Looking Glass Studios\">Looking Glass Studios</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/Thief:_The_Dark_Project\" title=\"Thief: The Dark Project\">Thief: The Dark Project</a></i> and its sequel were the first to coin the term \"first person sneaker\", although it is questionable whether they are the first \"first person stealth\" games. Turn-based strategy progressed further, with the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic\" title=\"Heroes of Might and Magic\">Heroes of Might and Magic</a></i> (<i>HOMM</i>) series (from <a href=\"/wiki/The_3DO_Company\" title=\"The 3DO Company\">The 3DO Company</a>) luring many mainstream gamers into this complex genre.</p> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Id_Software\" title=\"Id Software\">Id Software</a>’s 1996 game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Quake_(video_game)\" title=\"Quake (video game)\">Quake</a></i> pioneered play over the Internet in <a href=\"/wiki/First-person_shooter\" title=\"First-person shooter\">first-person shooters</a>. Internet multiplayer capability became a de facto requirement in almost all FPS games. Other genres also began to offer online play, including RTS games like <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft_Studios\" title=\"Microsoft Studios\">Microsoft Game Studios</a>’ <i><a href=\"/wiki/Age_of_Empires\" title=\"Age of Empires\">Age of Empires</a></i>, <a href=\"/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment\" title=\"Blizzard Entertainment\">Blizzard</a>’s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Warcraft\" title=\"Warcraft\">Warcraft</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/StarCraft\" title=\"StarCraft\">StarCraft</a></i> series, and <a href=\"/wiki/Turn-based\" title=\"Turn-based\" class=\"mw-redirect\">turn-based</a> games such as <i>Heroes of Might and Magic</i>.

These are small single player or multiplayer games that can be quickly downloaded and played from within a web browser without installation.

Both consoles had very low sales and few quality games, eventually leading to their demise. In 1994, three new consoles were released in Japan: the <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Saturn\" title=\"Sega Saturn\">Sega Saturn</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Sony_PlayStation\" title=\"Sony PlayStation\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Sony PlayStation</a>, and the <a href=\"/wiki/PC-FX\" title=\"PC-FX\">PC-FX</a>, the Saturn and the PlayStation later seeing release in North America in 1995. The PlayStation quickly outsold all of its competitors mainly on the strength of its available titles, with the exception of the aging <a href=\"/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System\" title=\"Super Nintendo Entertainment System\">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, which still had the support of many major game companies.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Virtual_Boy\" title=\"Virtual Boy\">Virtual Boy</a> from Nintendo was released in 1995 as one of the first consumer consoles providing 3D depth perception, but did not achieve high sales, largely due to the monochrome display and the lack of third-party support. In 1996 the Virtual Boy was taken off the market.</p> <p>After many delays, during which Sony's PlayStation gained industry acceptance, Nintendo released its <a href=\"/wiki/64-bit_computing\" title=\"64-bit computing\">64-bit</a> console, the <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_64\" title=\"Nintendo 64\">Nintendo 64</a> in 1996. The console's flagship title, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Super_Mario_64\" title=\"Super Mario 64\">Super Mario 64</a></i>, became a defining title for 3D platformer games.</p> <p><i><a href=\"/wiki/PaRappa_the_Rapper\" title=\"PaRappa the Rapper\">PaRappa the Rapper</a></i> popularized <a href=\"/wiki/Music_video_game\" title=\"Music video game\">music video games</a> in Japan with its 1996 debut on the <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation\" title=\"PlayStation\">PlayStation</a>.

While <i>Parappa</i>, <i>DDR</i>, and other games found a cult following when brought to North America, music games would not gain a wide audience in the market until the next decade with titles like <a href=\"/wiki/Guitar_Hero\" title=\"Guitar Hero\">Guitar Hero</a>. Also in 1996 <a href=\"/wiki/Capcom\" title=\"Capcom\">Capcom</a> released <a href=\"/wiki/Resident_Evil\" title=\"Resident Evil\">Resident Evil</a>, the first well known survival horror game.

The title also featured many innovations such as <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Z-targeting&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Z-targeting (page does not exist)\">Z-targeting</a>, which has persisted through subsequent Zelda titles on newer consoles and is commonly used in many other franchises today.</p> <p>Nintendo's choice to continue using ROM cartridges instead of moving to CD-ROMs for the Nintendo 64, unique among the consoles of this period, proved to have negative consequences for the console and for Nintendo's market share. While cartridges had faster access times, were more durable and resistant to piracy, CDs could hold far more data (650MB, over ten times the capacity of the largest N64 ROM at 64MB) and were much cheaper to produce, causing many game companies to turn to Nintendo's CD-based competitors. In particular, <a href=\"/wiki/Square_(company)\" title=\"Square (company)\">Square Enix</a>, which had released all previous games in its <i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Fantasy\" title=\"Final Fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a></i> series for Nintendo consoles, now turned exclusively to the PlayStation; <i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII\" title=\"Final Fantasy VII\">Final Fantasy VII</a></i> (1997) was a massive success, establishing the popularity of <a href=\"/wiki/Role-playing_video_game\" title=\"Role-playing video game\">role-playing video games</a> in the west and making the PlayStation the primary console for the genre, taking the crown from Nintendo who had enjoyed it with the SNES and Square's then Nintendo-exclusive <i>Final Fantasy</i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Secret_of_Mana\" title=\"Secret of Mana\">Secret of Mana</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Chrono_Trigger\" title=\"Chrono Trigger\">Chrono Trigger</a></i> titles. Copies of FFVII still command like-new prices of between US$30–$50 on the used market. Square would not return to Nintendo's main console platforms until 2003 with the <a href=\"/wiki/GameCube\" title=\"GameCube\">GameCube</a> and the cross-platform title <i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Fantasy_Crystal_Chronicles\" title=\"Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles\">Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a></i> (the only Square-published title for that console), and has not, to date, released a \"main series\" Final Fantasy title for a Nintendo platform since FFVI for the SNES. <a href=\"/wiki/Capcom\" title=\"Capcom\">Capcom</a> also largely departed from Nintendo during the N64 days; the next 4 installments of its popular <a href=\"/wiki/Mega_Man\" title=\"Mega Man\">Mega Man</a> 2D platform shooter were released on PlayStation and Saturn. Capcom was somewhat quicker and more eager to return than Square, however, providing two anthologies of Mega Man titles for the <a href=\"/wiki/GameCube\" title=\"GameCube\">GameCube</a>, including Mega Man 8 and Mega Man X4-6 that Nintendo players had missed.</p> <p>By the end of this period, Sony had become the leader in the video game market. The Saturn was moderately successful in Japan but a commercial failure in North America and Europe, leaving Sega outside of the main competition. The N64 achieved huge success in North America and Europe, though it never surpassed PlayStation's sales or was as popular in Japan, and began to show a decline in third-party support for Nintendo's home consoles.</p> <p>This generation ended with the discontinuation of the PlayStation (known in its re-engineered form as the \"PSOne\") in March 2006.</p> <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Transition_to_3D_and_CDs\">Transition to 3D and CDs</span></h4> <p>The fifth generation is most noted for the rise of fully <a href=\"/wiki/3D_computer_graphics\" title=\"3D computer graphics\">3D</a> games. While there were games prior that had used three dimensional environments, such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Virtua_Racing\" title=\"Virtua Racing\">Virtua Racing</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Fox_(video_game)\" title=\"Star Fox (video game)\">Star Fox</a></i>, it was in this era that many game designers began to move traditionally <a href=\"/wiki/2D_computer_graphics\" title=\"2D computer graphics\">2D</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/2.5D\" title=\"2.5D\">pseudo-3D</a> genres into full 3D. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Super_Mario_64\" title=\"Super Mario 64\">Super Mario 64</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time\" title=\"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a></i> on the N64, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Crash_Bandicoot_(video_game)\" title=\"Crash Bandicoot (video game)\">Crash Bandicoot</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Spyro_the_Dragon_(video_game)\" title=\"Spyro the Dragon (video game)\">Spyro the Dragon</a></i> on the PlayStation and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nights_into_Dreams...\" title=\"Nights into Dreams...\">Nights into Dreams...</a></i> on the Saturn, are prime examples of this trend. Their 3D environments were widely marketed and they steered the industry's focus away from side-scrolling and rail-style titles, as well as opening doors to more complex games and genres. Games like <i><a href=\"/wiki/GoldenEye_007_(1997_video_game)\" title=\"GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)\">GoldenEye 007</a></i>, <i>Ocarina of Time</i> or <i><a href=\"/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_(series)\" title=\"Virtua Fighter (series)\">Virtua Fighter</a></i> were nothing like shoot-em-ups, RPGs or fighting games before them. 3D became the main focus in this era as well as a slow decline of cartridges in favor of CDs, which allowed much greater storage capacity than what was previously possible. The N64 was the last major home console to use the cartridge format, although it persists to this day in handheld games on Nintendo and Sony devices using memory cards similar to <a href=\"/wiki/Secure_Digital\" title=\"Secure Digital\">SD cards</a>.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mobile_phone_gaming\">Mobile phone gaming</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Mobile_game\" title=\"Mobile game\">Mobile game</a></div> <p>Mobile phones began becoming video gaming platforms when <a href=\"/wiki/Nokia\" title=\"Nokia\">Nokia</a> installed <i><a href=\"/wiki/Snake_(video_game)\" title=\"Snake (video game)\">Snake</a></i> onto its line of mobile phones in 1997 (Nokia 6110).

The most famous example is that of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Counter-Strike\" title=\"Counter-Strike\">Counter-Strike</a></i>; released in 1999, it is still one of the most popular online first-person shooter, even though it was created as a mod for <i><a href=\"/wiki/Half-Life_(video_game)\" title=\"Half-Life (video game)\">Half-Life</a></i> by two independent programmers. Eventually, game designers realized the potential of mods and custom content in general to enhance the value of their games, and so began to encourage its creation. Some examples of this include <i><a href=\"/wiki/Unreal_Tournament\" title=\"Unreal Tournament\">Unreal Tournament</a></i>, which allowed players to import 3dsmax scenes to use as character models, and <a href=\"/wiki/Maxis\" title=\"Maxis\">Maxis</a>' <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Sims\" title=\"The Sims\">The Sims</a></i>, for which players could create custom objects.</p> <p>In China, video game consoles were banned in June 2000. This has led to an explosion in the popularity of computer games, especially MMOs. Consoles and the games for them are easily acquired however, as there is a robust grey market importing and distributing them across the country. Another side effect of this law has been rampant video game piracy.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sixth_generation_consoles_.281998.E2.80.932013.29\">Sixth generation consoles (1998–2013)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(sixth_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (sixth generation)\">History of video game consoles (sixth generation)</a></div> <p>In the sixth generation of video game consoles, Sega exited the hardware market, Nintendo fell behind, Sony solidified its lead in the industry, and Microsoft developed a gaming console.</p> <p>The generation opened with the launch of the <a href=\"/wiki/Dreamcast\" title=\"Dreamcast\">Dreamcast</a> in 1998. It was the first console to have a built-in modem for Internet support and online play. While it was initially successful, sales and popularity would soon begin to decline with contributing factors being Sega's damaged reputation from the relative failures of the 32X and Saturn, software pirating, and the overwhelming anticipation for the upcoming <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_2\" title=\"PlayStation 2\">PlayStation 2</a>. Production for the console would discontinue in most markets by 2002 and would be Sega's final console before it reorganized its business as a third party game provider only, partnering primarily with its old rival Nintendo.</p> <p>The second release of the generation was Sony's PlayStation 2, which featured DVD-based game discs with 4.7GB capacity, increased processor and graphics capability over its predecessor including progressive-scan component video connections, built-in 4-player connection capability, available Ethernet adapter (which became built-in with the winter 2004 release of the \"slimline\" PS2 chassis), and the ability to play DVD movies and audio CDs, eliminating the need for a separate DVD player and making the PS2 a complete home entertainment console.</p> <p>Nintendo followed a year later with the <a href=\"/wiki/GameCube\" title=\"GameCube\">GameCube</a> (code-named \"Dolphin\" while in development), its first optical disc-based console, which used 80mm \"mini-DVD\" discs holding 1.4GB of data each (over 200 times the capacity of the largest N64 cartridge ROM). While it had the component-video capability of its contemporaries, the GameCube suffered in several ways compared to Sony's PS2. First, the PS2's high anticipation and one-year head start gained it player and developer attention before the GCN's release. As a result, the GameCube had less third-party backing and very few third-party exclusives, mostly from Nintendo-faithful studios such as the now-defunct <a href=\"/wiki/Rare_Ltd.\" title=\"Rare Ltd.\">Rare Ltd.</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Midway_Games\" title=\"Midway Games\">Midway Games</a>, and ironically its old rival <a href=\"/wiki/Sega\" title=\"Sega\">Sega</a> which released several of its Sonic the Hedgehog titles originally planned for Dreamcast. Cross-platform giants like <a href=\"/wiki/Capcom\" title=\"Capcom\">Capcom</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Arts\" title=\"Electronic Arts\">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Activision\" title=\"Activision\">Activision</a> released most of their GameCube titles on other consoles as well, while other developers like <a href=\"/wiki/Square_Enix\" title=\"Square Enix\">Square Enix</a> continued to release high-demand PS2 exclusives like Final Fantasy X. The GCN's game disc capacity was a third that of the PS2's full-size DVD disks, forcing a few games to be released on multiple discs and most titles to compromise on texture quality and other features of GameCube games, when other platforms had no such limitations on their versions. It had no backwards-compatibility with the now-obsolete cartridges of the N64 (its only cartridge-based adapter allowed playing Game Boy/GBC/GBA games), making the GCN's title count a small fraction of the combined titles for the PlayStation and PS2 that were playable on the fully backward-compatible PS2 console. It was a dedicated game console, with the optical drive being too small to hold a full-size CD or DVD.</p> <p>Lastly, and most significantly, the GameCube was hindered by a not-undeserved reputation for being a \"kid's console\", due to its initial launch color scheme (mostly purple, derived from the SNES but with the colors reversed; Nintendo would later release a grey-on-black version), small gamepad design with no neutral color options and a face button layout catering to smaller and less-coordinated hands (though the reversal of the D-pad and the left analog stick positions as compared to the Dual Shock controller of the PlayStation was an advantage to many), and lack of mature-content games which the current market appeared to want. Though T- and M-rated titles including the GCN-exclusive <a href=\"/wiki/Metroid_Prime\" title=\"Metroid Prime\">Metroid Prime</a> franchise did exist, the overwhelming majority of GCN games were E-rated and mostly cartoon-style in their art design.</p> <p>Before the end of 2001, Microsoft Corporation, best known for its <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\" title=\"Microsoft Windows\">Windows</a> operating system and its professional productivity software, entered the console market with the <a href=\"/wiki/Xbox_(console)\" title=\"Xbox (console)\">Xbox</a>. Based on Intel's Pentium III CPU, the console used a great deal of PC technology to leverage its internal development, including the ability for developers to write games that leveraged the popular <a href=\"/wiki/DirectX\" title=\"DirectX\">DirectX</a> accelerated-graphics library and other Windows-based APIs, making games for PC easily portable to the Xbox. In order to gain market share and maintain its toehold in the market, Microsoft reportedly sold the Xbox at a significant loss and concentrated on drawing profit from game development and publishing. Shortly after its release in November 2001 <a href=\"/wiki/Bungie\" title=\"Bungie\">Bungie Studio's</a> <i><a href=\"/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved\" title=\"Halo: Combat Evolved\">Halo: Combat Evolved</a></i> instantly became the driving point of the Xbox's success, and the <a href=\"/wiki/Halo_(series)\" title=\"Halo (series)\">Halo series</a> would later go on to become one of the most successful console shooters of all time. By the end of the generation, the Xbox had drawn even with the Nintendo GameCube in sales globally, but since nearly all of its sales were in North America, it pushed Nintendo into third place in the American market.</p> <p>In 2001 <i><a href=\"/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_III\" title=\"Grand Theft Auto III\">Grand Theft Auto III</a></i> was released, popularizing open world games by using a non-linear style of gameplay. It was very successful both critically and commercially and is considered a huge milestone in gaming. It was also yet another set piece in the debate over video game violence and adult content, with advocacy groups decrying the series' glorification of prostitution, the mafia, and of course violence, including violence against first responders such as police and EMS.</p> <p>Nintendo still dominated the handheld gaming market in this generation. The <a href=\"/wiki/Game_Boy_Advance\" title=\"Game Boy Advance\">Game Boy Advance</a> in 2001, maintained Nintendo's market position with a high-resolution, full-color LCD screen and 16-bit processor allowing ports of SNES games and simpler companions to N64 and GameCube games. Finnish cellphone maker Nokia entered the handheld scene with the <a href=\"/wiki/N-Gage_(device)\" title=\"N-Gage (device)\">N-Gage</a>, but it failed to win a significant following.</p> <p>Console gaming largely continued the trend established by the PlayStation toward increasingly complex, sophisticated, and adult-oriented gameplay. Game developers continued to cater to the late Gen-X and early Gen-Y gamers that had been their base as pre-teens and tweens in the 1970s and 80s, and were now in their twenties and thirties. Most of the successful sixth-generation console games were rated T and M by the <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">ESRB</a>, includi",
			"wn portable games, many of which were copies of Game &amp; Watch titles or adaptations of popular arcade games. Improving <a href=\"/wiki/Liquid-crystal_display\" title=\"Liquid-crystal display\">LCD</a> technology meant the new handhelds could be more reliable and consume fewer batteries than <a href=\"/wiki/Light-emitting_diode\" title=\"Light-emitting diode\">LED</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Vacuum_fluorescent_display\" title=\"Vacuum fluorescent display\">VFD</a> games, most only needing watch batteries. They could also be made much smaller than most LED handhelds, even small enough to wear on one’s wrist like a watch. <a href=\"/wiki/Tiger_Electronics\" title=\"Tiger Electronics\">Tiger Electronics</a> borrowed this concept of videogaming with cheap, affordable handhelds and still produces games in this model to the present day.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Video_game_crash_of_1983\">Video game crash of 1983</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983\" title=\"North American video game crash of 1983\">North American video game crash of 1983</a></div> <p>At the end of 1983, the industry experienced a downturn. This was the \"crash\" of the video game industry, as well as the bankruptcy of several companies that produced North American home computers and video game consoles from late 1983 to early 1984. It brought an end to what is considered to be the second generation of console video gaming. Causes of the crash include the production of poorly designed games, an immature distribution system which left retail stuck with unsold copies to discount, as well as a general thought among retail that video games were just another toy fad and that home computers were the next big thing.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Third_generation_consoles_.281983.E2.80.931995.29_.288-bit.29\">Third generation consoles (1983–1995) (8-bit)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(third_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (third generation)\">History of video game consoles (third generation)</a></div> <p>In 1985, the American video game console market was revived with Nintendo’s release of its <a href=\"/wiki/8-bit\" title=\"8-bit\">8-bit</a> console, the Famicom (a portmanteau of \"Family Computer\"), known outside Asia as the <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System\" title=\"Nintendo Entertainment System\">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> (NES). In its original release it was offered in three tiered bundles: the Control Deck bundle came in two versions, one with no game and priced at $89.99, and one with <i><a href=\"/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.\" title=\"Super Mario Bros.\">Super Mario Bros.</a></i> priced at $99.99, and both including two controllers. The third version offered was the Deluxe Set, retailing at US$199.99, and included <a href=\"/wiki/R.O.B.\" title=\"R.O.B.\">R.O.B.</a>, a light gun, two controllers, and two game paks: Gyromite, and Duck Hunt. More packages were offered in the following few years including The Action Set released in 1988 for US$149.99, which came with the console, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual game pack containing Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt, and the Power Set was released in 1989 and came with the console, two game controllers, a NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and triple game pack containing Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. The NES instantly became a success, dominating the North American and Japanese home console gaming markets until the rise of the next generation of 16-bit consoles in the early 1990s. Other markets were not as heavily dominated by Nintendo, because of heavy competition from Home Computers like the <a href=\"/wiki/ZX_Spectrum\" title=\"ZX Spectrum\">ZX Spectrum</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Amstrad_CPC\" title=\"Amstrad CPC\">Amstrad CPC</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_64\" title=\"Commodore 64\">Commodore 64</a> preventing the NES having much success in Europe, or lack of marketing, allowing other consoles to find an audience like the <a href=\"/wiki/Master_System\" title=\"Master System\">Master System</a> in Australia and Brazil (the Master System was also sold in North America and Japan, but was less successful).</p> <p>In the new consoles, the <a href=\"/wiki/Gamepad\" title=\"Gamepad\">gamepad</a> or joypad, took over for <a href=\"/wiki/Joystick\" title=\"Joystick\">joysticks</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Paddle_(game_controller)\" title=\"Paddle (game controller)\">paddles</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Keypad\" title=\"Keypad\">keypads</a> as the default <a href=\"/wiki/Game_controller\" title=\"Game controller\">game controller</a> included with the system. The gamepad design of an 8 direction Directional-pad (or <a href=\"/wiki/D-pad\" title=\"D-pad\">D-pad</a> for short) with 2 or more action buttons became the standard. This generation also marked a shift in the dominance of home video game console hardware and <a href=\"/wiki/Console_game\" title=\"Console game\">console game</a> production from the United States to Japan.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda\" title=\"The Legend of Zelda\"><i>Legend of Zelda</i> series</a> made its debut in 1986 with <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)\" title=\"The Legend of Zelda (video game)\">The Legend of Zelda</a></i>. In the same year, the <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_Quest\" title=\"Dragon Quest\">Dragon Quest</a></i> series debuted with <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dragon_Warrior\" title=\"Dragon Warrior\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior)</a></i>, and has created a phenomenon in Japanese culture ever since. The next year, the Japanese company <a href=\"/wiki/Square_(company)\" title=\"Square (company)\">Square</a> was struggling and <a href=\"/wiki/Hironobu_Sakaguchi\" title=\"Hironobu Sakaguchi\">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> decided to make his final game—a role-playing game (RPG) modeled after <i>Dragon Quest</i> and titled <i><a href=\"/wiki/Final_Fantasy_(video_game)\" title=\"Final Fantasy (video game)\">Final Fantasy</a></i>—resulting in the <a href=\"/wiki/Final_Fantasy\" title=\"Final Fantasy\"><i>Final Fantasy</i> series</a>, which would go on to become the world's most successful RPG franchise spawning 15 main series titles to date and a host of spin-off games, movies and other media. 1987 also saw the birth of the <a href=\"/wiki/Stealth_game\" title=\"Stealth game\">stealth game</a> genre with <a href=\"/wiki/Hideo_Kojima\" title=\"Hideo Kojima\">Hideo Kojima</a>’s <a href=\"/wiki/Metal_Gear\" title=\"Metal Gear\"><i>Metal Gear</i> series</a>' first game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Metal_Gear_(video_game)\" title=\"Metal Gear (video game)\">Metal Gear</a></i> on the <a href=\"/wiki/MSX\" title=\"MSX\">MSX</a>2 computer—ported to the NES shortly after.

Large computer-game companies such as <a href=\"/wiki/Epyx\" title=\"Epyx\">Epyx</a>, Electronic Arts, and LucasArts began devoting much or all of their attention on console games. <i>Computer Gaming World</i> warned that computer gaming could become a \"cultural backwater\" similar to what had happened a few years earlier with 8-bit computers. In 1990, Commodore and Amstrad entered the console market with their <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_64_Games_System\" title=\"Commodore 64 Games System\">C64GS</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Amstrad_GX4000\" title=\"Amstrad GX4000\">GX4000</a> game machines respectively. These were both based on the 8-bit computers of their manufacturers, and had only limited success due to a lack of software support and the arrival of 16-bit machines. Amstrad's GX4000 sold just over 15,000 units, with only 25 officially released game cartridges. Even though it was technically superior to the Master System and Nintendo Entertainment System, it was discontinued after 6 months.</p> <p>This generation ended with the discontinuation of the NES in 1995.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"1990s\">1990s</span></h2> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/1990s_in_video_gaming\" title=\"1990s in video gaming\">1990s in video gaming</a></div> <table class=\"metadata plainlinks ambox ambox-content ambox-Refimprove\" role=\"presentation\"> <tbody> <tr> <td class=\"mbox-image\"> <div style=\"width:52px\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:Question_book-new.svg\" class=\"image\"></a></div> </td> <td class=\"mbox-text\"><span class=\"mbox-text-span\">This article <b>needs additional citations for <a href=\"/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability\" title=\"Wikipedia:Verifiability\">verification</a></b>. <span class=\"hide-when-compact\">Please help <a class=\"external text\" href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_video_games&amp;action=edit\">improve this article</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Help:Introduction_to_referencing/1\" title=\"Help:Introduction to referencing/1\">adding citations to reliable sources</a>.

According to SCE's former producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, the PlayStation was originally being considered as a <a href=\"/wiki/2D_computer_graphics\" title=\"2D computer graphics\">2D</a> focused hardware, and it wasn't until the success of <i>Virtua Fighter</i> in the arcades that they decided to design the PlayStation as a 3D focused hardware. <a href=\"/wiki/Texture_mapping\" title=\"Texture mapping\">Texture mapping</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Texture_filtering\" title=\"Texture filtering\">texture filtering</a> were soon popularized by 3D <a href=\"/wiki/Racing_video_game\" title=\"Racing video game\">racing games</a> such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Ridge_Racer\" title=\"Ridge Racer\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Ridge Racer</a></i> on the <a href=\"/wiki/Namco_System_22\" title=\"Namco System 22\">Namco System 22</a> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Daytona_USA_(video_game)\" title=\"Daytona USA (video game)\">Daytona USA</a></i> on the <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Model_2\" title=\"Sega Model 2\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Sega Model 2</a>, while 3D fighting games such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tekken\" title=\"Tekken\">Tekken</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Soul_Edge\" title=\"Soul Edge\">Soul Edge</a></i> also gained popularity.</p> <p>With the advent of 32-bit consoles in the mid-1990s, however, home video game consoles such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Saturn\" title=\"Sega Saturn\">Sega Saturn</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation\" title=\"PlayStation\">PlayStation</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Nintendo_64\" title=\"Nintendo 64\">Nintendo 64</a> also became capable of producing texture-mapped 3D graphics. Increasing numbers of players would wait for popular arcade games to be ported to consoles rather than pumping coins into arcade kiosks. This trend increased with the introduction of more realistic peripherals for computer and console game systems such as <a href=\"/wiki/Haptic_technology#Games\" title=\"Haptic technology\">force feedback</a> aircraft joysticks and racing wheel/pedal kits, which allowed home systems to approach some of the realism and immersion previously limited to the arcades. In order to remain relevant, arcade manufacturers such as <a href=\"/wiki/Sega\" title=\"Sega\">Sega</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Namco\" title=\"Namco\">Namco</a> continued pushing the boundaries of 3D graphics beyond what was possible in homes. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Virtua_Fighter_3\" title=\"Virtua Fighter 3\">Virtua Fighter 3</a></i> for the <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Model_3\" title=\"Sega Model 3\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Sega Model 3</a>, for example, stood out for having real-time 3D graphics approaching the quality of <a href=\"/wiki/Computer_animation\" title=\"Computer animation\">CGI</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Full_motion_video\" title=\"Full motion video\">FMV</a> at the time. Likewise, Namco released the <a href=\"/wiki/Namco_System_23\" title=\"Namco System 23\">Namco System 23</a> to rival the Model 3. By 1998, however, Sega's <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(sixth_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (sixth generation)\">128-bit console</a>, the <a href=\"/wiki/Dreamcast\" title=\"Dreamcast\">Dreamcast</a>, could produce 3D graphics on-par with the <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Naomi\" title=\"Sega Naomi\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Naomi</a> arcade machine. After producing the more powerful <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Hikaru\" title=\"Sega Hikaru\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Hikaru</a> board in 1999 and <a href=\"/wiki/Sega_Naomi_2\" title=\"Sega Naomi 2\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Naomi 2</a> in 2000, Sega eventually stopped manufacturing custom arcade system boards, with their subsequent arcade boards being based on either consoles or commercial PC components.</p> <p>As patronage of arcades declined, many were forced to close down.

These newer arcade titles offered games based on driving, and sports like skiing or cycling, as well as <a href=\"/wiki/Rhythm_game\" title=\"Rhythm game\">rhythm games</a> like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution\" title=\"Dance Dance Revolution\">Dance Dance Revolution</a></i> and path-based shooting gallery games like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Time_Crisis\" title=\"Time Crisis\">Time Crisis</a></i>, which have carved out a large slice of the market. <a href=\"/wiki/Dave_%26_Buster%27s\" title=\"Dave &amp; Buster's\">Dave &amp; Buster's</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/GameWorks\" title=\"GameWorks\">GameWorks</a> are two large chains in the United States with this type of environment.

This second batch included the <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20\" title=\"Commodore VIC-20\">Commodore VIC-20</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_64\" title=\"Commodore 64\">64</a>; Sinclair <a href=\"/wiki/ZX80\" title=\"ZX80\">ZX80</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/ZX81\" title=\"ZX81\">ZX81</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/ZX_Spectrum\" title=\"ZX Spectrum\">ZX Spectrum</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/PC-8000_Series\" title=\"PC-8000 Series\">NEC PC-8000</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/NEC_PC-6001\" title=\"NEC PC-6001\">PC-6001</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/PC-8801\" title=\"PC-8801\">PC-88</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/NEC_PC-9801\" title=\"NEC PC-9801\">PC-98</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/X1_(computer)\" title=\"X1 (computer)\">Sharp X1</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/X68000\" title=\"X68000\">X68000</a>; and <a href=\"/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family\" title=\"Atari 8-bit family\">Atari 8-bit family</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/BBC_Micro\" title=\"BBC Micro\">BBC Micro</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Acorn_Electron\" title=\"Acorn Electron\">Acorn Electron</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Amstrad_CPC\" title=\"Amstrad CPC\">Amstrad CPC</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/MSX\" title=\"MSX\">MSX</a> series. These rivals helped to catalyze both the home computer and games markets, by raising awareness of computing and gaming through their competing advertising campaigns.</p> <p>The Sinclair, Acorn and Amstrad offerings were generally only known in Europe and Africa, the NEC and Sharp offerings were generally only known in Asia, and the MSX had a base in North and South America, Europe, and Asia, while the US-based Apple, Commodore and Atari offerings were sold in both the US and Europe.</p> <p>Games dominated home computers' software libraries. A 1984 compendium of reviews of Atari 8-bit software used 198 pages for games compared to 167 for all others. By that year the computer gaming market took over from the console market following the crash of that year; computers offered equal gaming ability and, since their simple design allowed games to take complete command of the hardware after power-on, they were nearly as simple to start playing with as consoles.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_64\" title=\"Commodore 64\">Commodore 64</a> was released to the public in August 1982. It found initial success because it was marketed and priced aggressively. It had a <a href=\"/wiki/BASIC\" title=\"BASIC\">BASIC</a> programming environment and advanced graphic and sound capabilities for its time, similar to the <a href=\"/wiki/ColecoVision\" title=\"ColecoVision\">ColecoVision</a> console. It also utilized the same game controller ports popularized by the Atari 2600, allowing gamers to use their old joysticks with the system. It would become the most popular home computer of its day in the USA and many other countries and the best-selling single computer model of all time internationally.</p> <p>At around the same time, the Sinclair <a href=\"/wiki/ZX_Spectrum\" title=\"ZX Spectrum\">ZX Spectrum</a> was released in the United Kingdom and quickly became the most popular home computer in many areas of Western Europe—and later the <a href=\"/wiki/Eastern_Bloc\" title=\"Eastern Bloc\">Eastern Bloc</a>—due to the ease with which clones could be produced.</p> <p>In 2008 <a href=\"/wiki/Sid_Meier\" title=\"Sid Meier\">Sid Meier</a> listed the IBM PC as one of the three most important innovations in the history of video games. The <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible\" title=\"IBM PC compatible\">IBM PC compatible</a> platform became a technically competitive gaming platform with IBM’s <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer/AT\" title=\"IBM Personal Computer/AT\">PC/AT</a> in 1984. The primitive <a href=\"/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter\" title=\"Color Graphics Adapter\">CGA</a> graphics of previous models, with only 4-color 320×200 pixel graphics (or, using special programming, 16-color 160×100 graphics) had limited the PC’s appeal to the business segment, as its graphics failed to compete with the C64 or Apple II. The new 64-color <a href=\"/wiki/Enhanced_Graphics_Adapter\" title=\"Enhanced Graphics Adapter\">EGA</a> display standard allowed its graphics to approach the quality seen in popular home computers like the Commodore 64. The sound capabilities of the AT, however, were still limited to the <a href=\"/wiki/PC_speaker\" title=\"PC speaker\">PC speaker</a>, which was substandard compared to the built-in <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_chip\" title=\"Sound chip\">sound chips</a> used in many home computers. Also, the relatively high cost of the PC compatible systems severely limited their popularity in gaming.</p> <p>The Apple <a href=\"/wiki/Macintosh\" title=\"Macintosh\">Macintosh</a> also arrived at this time. It lacked the color capabilities of the earlier <a href=\"/wiki/Apple_II_series\" title=\"Apple II series\">Apple II</a>, instead preferring a much higher pixel resolution, but the operating system support for the <a href=\"/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\" title=\"Graphical user interface\">GUI</a> attracted developers of some games (e.g. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Lode_Runner\" title=\"Lode Runner\">Lode Runner</a></i>) even before color returned in 1987 with the Mac II.</p> <p>The arrival of the <a href=\"/wiki/Atari_ST\" title=\"Atari ST\">Atari ST</a> and Commodore <a href=\"/wiki/Amiga\" title=\"Amiga\">Amiga</a> in 1985 was the beginning of a new era of 16-bit machines. For many users they were too expensive until later on in the decade, at which point advances in the IBM PC’s open platform had caused the <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible\" title=\"IBM PC compatible\">IBM PC compatibles</a> to become comparably powerful at a lower cost than their competitors. The <a href=\"/wiki/Video_Graphics_Array\" title=\"Video Graphics Array\">VGA</a> standard developed for IBM’s new <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2\" title=\"IBM Personal System/2\">PS/2</a> line in 1987 gave the PC the potential for 256-color graphics. This was a big jump ahead of most 8-bit home computers but still lagging behind platforms with built-in sound and graphics hardware like the Amiga. This caused an odd trend around '89–91 towards developing to a seemingly inferior machine. Thus while both the ST and Amiga were host to many technically excellent games, their time of prominence proved to be shorter than that of the 8-bit machines, which saw new ports well into the 1980s and even the 1990s.</p> <p>Dedicated <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_card\" title=\"Sound card\">sound cards</a> started to address the issue of poor sound capabilities in <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible\" title=\"IBM PC compatible\">IBM PC compatibles</a> in the late 1980s. <a href=\"/wiki/Ad_Lib,_Inc.\" title=\"Ad Lib, Inc.\">Ad Lib</a> set an early de facto standard for sound cards in 1987, with its card based on the <a href=\"/wiki/Yamaha_YM3812\" title=\"Yamaha YM3812\">Yamaha YM3812</a> sound chip. This would last until the introduction of <a href=\"/wiki/Creative_Technology\" title=\"Creative Technology\">Creative Labs</a>' <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_Blaster\" title=\"Sound Blaster\">Sound Blaster</a> in 1989, which took the chip and added new features while remaining compatible with <a href=\"/wiki/Ad_Lib,_Inc.\" title=\"Ad Lib, Inc.\">Ad Lib</a> cards, and creating a new de facto standard. However, many games would still support these and rarer things like the <a href=\"/wiki/Roland_MT-32\" title=\"Roland MT-32\">Roland MT-32</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Covox_Speech_Thing\" title=\"Covox Speech Thing\">Disney Sound Source</a> into the early 1990s. The initial high cost of sound cards meant they would not find widespread use until the 1990s.</p> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Shareware\" title=\"Shareware\">Shareware</a> gaming first appeared in the mid-1980s, but its big successes came in the 1990s.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_online_gaming\">Early online gaming</span></h3> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Dial-up_Internet_access\" title=\"Dial-up Internet access\">Dial-up</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\" title=\"Bulletin board system\">bulletin board systems</a> were popular in the 1980s, and sometimes used for online game playing. The earliest such systems were in the late 1970s and early 1980s and had a crude plain-text interface. Later systems made use of terminal-control codes (the so-called <a href=\"/wiki/ANSI_art\" title=\"ANSI art\">ANSI art</a>, which included the use of IBM-PC-specific characters not part of an <a href=\"/wiki/American_National_Standards_Institute\" title=\"American National Standards Institute\">ANSI</a> standard) to get a <a href=\"/wiki/Box-drawing_character\" title=\"Box-drawing character\">pseudo-graphical</a> interface. Some BBSs offered access to various games which were playable through such an interface, ranging from text adventures to gambling games like <a href=\"/wiki/Blackjack\" title=\"Blackjack\">blackjack</a> (generally played for \"points\" rather than real money). On some multiuser BBSs (where more than one person could be online at once), there were games allowing users to interact with one another.</p> <p><a href=\"/wiki/SuperSet_Software\" title=\"SuperSet Software\">SuperSet Software</a> created <i><a href=\"/wiki/Snipes_(video_game)\" title=\"Snipes (video game)\">Snipes</a></i>, a text-mode networked computer game in 1983 to test a new <a href=\"/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer\" title=\"IBM Personal Computer\">IBM Personal Computer</a>–based computer network and demonstrate its capabilities. <i>Snipes</i> is officially credited as being the original inspiration for <a href=\"/wiki/NetWare\" title=\"NetWare\">NetWare</a>. It is believed to be the first network game ever written for a commercial personal computer and is recognized alongside 1974’s <i><a href=\"/wiki/Maze_War\" title=\"Maze War\">Maze War</a></i> (a networked multiplayer maze game for several research machines) and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Spasim\" title=\"Spasim\">Spasim</a></i> (a 3D multiplayer space simulation for time shared <a href=\"/wiki/Mainframe_computer\" title=\"Mainframe computer\">mainframes</a>) as the precursor to multiplayer games such as 1987's <i><a href=\"/wiki/MIDI_Maze\" title=\"MIDI Maze\">MIDI Maze</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Doom_(video_game)\" title=\"Doom (video game)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Doom</a></i> in 1993.

These services ultimately became obsolete when game producers began including their own online software such as <a href=\"/wiki/Battle.net\" title=\"Battle.net\">Battle.net</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/World_Opponent_Network\" title=\"World Opponent Network\">WON</a> and later <a href=\"/wiki/Steam_(software)\" title=\"Steam (software)\">Steam</a>.</p> <p>The first user interfaces were plain-text—similar to BBSs— but they operated on large mainframe computers, permitting larger numbers of users to be online at once.

Indeed, Magnavox almost dropped the Odyssey entirely at the end of the year, but ultimately decided to do a modest second manufacturing run in 1973. Sales were hampered in part by the relatively high price of the system, advertising that implied the system was only compatible with Magnavox televisions, and limited distribution exclusively through Magnavox-authorized franchise dealers. While the system failed to catch on in a big way, however, its legacy would be the birth of a vibrant video arcade game industry when Ralph Baer's design ingenuity intersected Nolan Bushnell's entrepreneurial ambition.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"A_new_industry\">A new industry</span></h2> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_arcade_video_games_.281971.E2.80.931977.29\">Early arcade video games (1971–1977)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">Arcade game</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(first_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (first generation)\">History of video game consoles (first generation)</a></div> <p>Bushnell and Dabney founded <a href=\"/wiki/Atari,_Inc.\" title=\"Atari, Inc.\">Atari, Inc.</a> in 1972, before releasing their next game: <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pong\" title=\"Pong\">Pong</a></i>. <i>Pong</i> was the first arcade video game with widespread success.

There is little record of all but the most popular games, as they were not marketed or regarded as a serious endeavor. The people–generally students–writing these games often were doing so illicitly by making questionable use of very expensive computing resources, and thus were not eager to let very many people know of their endeavors. There were, however, at least two notable distribution paths for student game designers of this time:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href=\"/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)\" title=\"PLATO (computer system)\">PLATO system</a> was an educational computing environment designed at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Illinois_at_Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign\" title=\"University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign\">University of Illinois</a> which ran on mainframes made by <a href=\"/wiki/Control_Data_Corporation\" title=\"Control Data Corporation\">Control Data Corporation</a>. Games were often exchanged between different PLATO systems.</li> <li><a href=\"/wiki/DECUS\" title=\"DECUS\">DECUS</a> was the <a href=\"/wiki/Users%27_group\" title=\"Users' group\">user group</a> for computers made by <a href=\"/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation\" title=\"Digital Equipment Corporation\">Digital Equipment Corporation</a> (DEC). It distributed programs–including games–that would run on the various types of DEC computers.</li> </ul> <p>A number of noteworthy games were also written for <a href=\"/wiki/Hewlett-Packard\" title=\"Hewlett-Packard\">Hewlett-Packard</a> minicomputers such as the <a href=\"/wiki/HP_2100\" title=\"HP 2100\">HP2000</a>.</p> <p>Highlights of this period, in approximate chronological order, include:</p> <ul> <li>1971: <a href=\"/wiki/Don_Daglow\" title=\"Don Daglow\">Don Daglow</a> wrote the first interactive baseball game, <a href=\"/wiki/Baseball_(1971_video_game)\" title=\"Baseball (1971 video game)\">computer baseball</a>, on a DEC <a href=\"/wiki/PDP-10\" title=\"PDP-10\">PDP-10</a> mainframe at <a href=\"/wiki/Pomona_College\" title=\"Pomona College\">Pomona College</a>. Players could manage play-by-play strategy for individual games, or simulate an entire season. Daglow went on to team with programmer <a href=\"/wiki/Eddie_Dombrower\" title=\"Eddie Dombrower\">Eddie Dombrower</a> to design <i><a href=\"/wiki/Earl_Weaver_Baseball\" title=\"Earl Weaver Baseball\">Earl Weaver Baseball</a></i>, published by <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Arts\" title=\"Electronic Arts\">Electronic Arts</a> in 1987.</li> <li>1971: <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek_(text_game)\" title=\"Star Trek (text game)\">Star Trek</a></i> was created (probably by <a href=\"/wiki/Mike_Mayfield\" title=\"Mike Mayfield\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Mike Mayfield</a>) on a <a href=\"/wiki/SDS_Sigma_series\" title=\"SDS Sigma series\">Sigma 7</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Minicomputer\" title=\"Minicomputer\">minicomputer</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_California\" title=\"University of California\">University of California</a>. This is the best-known and most widely played of the 1970s <i>Star Trek</i> titles, and was played on a series of small \"maps\" of galactic sectors printed on paper or on the screen. It was the first major game to be ported across hardware platforms by students. Daglow also wrote a popular <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek_(script_game)\" title=\"Star Trek (script game)\">Star Trek game</a></i> for the PDP-10 during 1970–1972, which presented the action as a script spoken by the <a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series\" title=\"Star Trek: The Original Series\">TV program</a>'s characters. A number of other <i>Star Trek</i> themed games were also available via PLATO and DECUS throughout the decade.</li> <li>1972: <a href=\"/wiki/Gregory_Yob\" title=\"Gregory Yob\">Gregory Yob</a> wrote the hide-and-seek game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Hunt_the_Wumpus\" title=\"Hunt the Wumpus\">Hunt the Wumpus</a></i> for the PDP-10, which could be considered the first text adventure. Yob wrote it in reaction to existing hide-and-seek games such as <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Hurkle&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Hurkle (page does not exist)\">Hurkle</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Mugwump_(game)\" title=\"Mugwump (game)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Mugwump</a></i>, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/What_to_Do_After_You_Hit_Return_or_P.C.C.%27s_First_Book_of_Computer_Games\" title=\"What to Do After You Hit Return or P.C.C.'s First Book of Computer Games\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Snark</a></i>.</li> <li>1974: Both <i><a href=\"/wiki/Maze_War\" title=\"Maze War\">Maze War</a></i> (on the <a href=\"/wiki/Imlac_PDS-1\" title=\"Imlac PDS-1\">Imlac PDS-1</a> at the <a href=\"/wiki/Ames_Research_Center\" title=\"Ames Research Center\">Ames Research Center</a> in California) and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Spasim\" title=\"Spasim\">Spasim</a></i> (on PLATO) appeared, pioneering examples of early multi-player 3D <a href=\"/wiki/First-person_shooter\" title=\"First-person shooter\">first-person shooters</a>.</li> <li>1974: <a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Brand_Fortner&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Brand Fortner (page does not exist)\">Brand Fortner</a> and others developed <i><a href=\"/w/index.php?title=Airfight&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Airfight (page does not exist)\">Airfight</a></i> as an educational flight simulator. To make it more interesting, all players shared an airspace flying their choice of military jets, loaded with selected weapons and fuel and to fulfill their desire to shoot down other players' aircraft. Despite mediocre graphics and slow screen refresh, it became a popular game on the <a href=\"/wiki/PLATO_(computer_system)\" title=\"PLATO (computer system)\">PLATO system</a>. <i>Airfight</i> was the inspiration for what became the Microsoft Flight Simulator.</li> <li>1975: <a href=\"/wiki/William_Crowther_(computer_programmer)\" title=\"William Crowther (computer programmer)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">William Crowther</a> wrote the first modern <a href=\"/wiki/Interactive_fiction\" title=\"Interactive fiction\">text adventure</a> game, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure\" title=\"Colossal Cave Adventure\">Adventure</a></i> (originally called <i>ADVENT</i>, and later <i>Colossal Cave</i>). It was programmed in <a href=\"/wiki/Fortran\" title=\"Fortran\">Fortran</a> for the PDP-10. The player controls the game through simple sentence-like text commands and receives descriptive text as output. The game was later re-created by students on PLATO, so it is one of the few titles that became part of both the PLATO and DEC traditions.</li> <li>1975: By 1975, many universities had discarded these terminals for <a href=\"/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube\" title=\"Cathode ray tube\">CRT</a> screens, which could display thirty lines of text in a few seconds instead of the minute or more that printing on paper required. This led to the development of a series of games that drew \"graphics\" on the screen. The CRTs replaced the typical <a href=\"/wiki/Teleprinter\" title=\"Teleprinter\">teleprinters</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Line_printer\" title=\"Line printer\">line printers</a> that output at speeds ranging from 10 to 30 characters per second.</li> <li>1975: Daglow, then a student at <a href=\"/wiki/Claremont_Graduate_University\" title=\"Claremont Graduate University\">Claremont Graduate University</a>, wrote the first <a href=\"/wiki/Role-playing_video_game\" title=\"Role-playing video game\">role-playing video game</a> on PDP-10 mainframes: <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)\" title=\"Dungeon (video game)\">Dungeon</a></i>.

Although displayed in text, it was the first game to use <i><a href=\"/wiki/Line_of_sight_(gaming)\" title=\"Line of sight (gaming)\">line of sight</a></i> graphics, as the top-down dungeon maps showing the areas that the party had seen or could see took into consideration factors such as light or darkness and the differences in vision between species.</li> <li>1975: At about the same time, the game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dnd_(video_game)\" title=\"Dnd (video game)\">dnd</a></i>, also based on <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> first appeared on PLATO system CDC computers. For players in these schools <i>dnd</i>, not <i>Dungeon</i>, was the first computer role-playing video game.</li> <li>1976: The earliest <a href=\"/wiki/Role-playing_video_game\" title=\"Role-playing video game\">role-playing video games</a> to use elements from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons\" title=\"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></i> are <i><a href=\"/wiki/Telengard\" title=\"Telengard\">Telengard</a></i>, written in 1976, and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Zork\" title=\"Zork\">Zork</a></i> (later renamed <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)\" title=\"Dungeon (video game)\">Dungeon</a></i>), written in 1977.</li> <li>1977: <a href=\"/wiki/Kelton_Flinn\" title=\"Kelton Flinn\">Kelton Flinn</a> and John Taylor create the first version of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Air_(1977_video_game)\" title=\"Air (1977 video game)\">Air</a></i>, a text air combat game that foreshadowed their later work creating the first-ever graphical online multi-player game, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Air_Warrior\" title=\"Air Warrior\">Air Warrior</a></i>. They would found the first successful online game company, <a href=\"/wiki/Kesmai\" title=\"Kesmai\">Kesmai</a>, now part of <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Arts\" title=\"Electronic Arts\">Electronic Arts</a>. As Flinn has said: \"If Air Warrior was a primate swinging in the trees, AIR was the text-based amoeba crawling on the ocean floor. But it was quasi-real time, multi-player, and attempted to render 3-D on the terminal using ASCII graphics. It was an acquired taste.\"</li> <li>1977: The writing of the original <i><a href=\"/wiki/Zork\" title=\"Zork\">Zork</a></i> was started by <a href=\"/wiki/Dave_Lebling\" title=\"Dave Lebling\">Dave Lebling</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Marc_Blank\" title=\"Marc Blank\">Marc Blank</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Tim_Anderson_(Zork)\" title=\"Tim Anderson (Zork)\">Tim Anderson</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Bruce_Daniels\" title=\"Bruce Daniels\">Bruce Daniels</a>. Unlike Crowther, Daglow and Yob, the Zork team recognized the potential to move these games to the new personal computers and they founded <a href=\"/wiki/Interactive_fiction\" title=\"Interactive fiction\">text adventure</a> publisher <a href=\"/wiki/Infocom\" title=\"Infocom\">Infocom</a> in 1979. The company was later sold to <a href=\"/wiki/Activision\" title=\"Activision\">Activision</a>.</li> <li>1978: <i><a href=\"/wiki/MUD1\" title=\"MUD1\">Multi-User Dungeon</a></i>, the first <a href=\"/wiki/MUD\" title=\"MUD\">MUD</a>, was created by <a href=\"/wiki/Roy_Trubshaw\" title=\"Roy Trubshaw\">Roy Trubshaw</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Richard_Bartle\" title=\"Richard Bartle\">Richard Bartle</a>, beginning the heritage that culminates with today's <a href=\"/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game\" title=\"Massively multiplayer online role-playing game\">MMORPGs</a>.</li> <li>1980: Michael Toy, Glenn Wichman and <a href=\"/wiki/Ken_Arnold\" title=\"Ken Arnold\">Ken Arnold</a> released <a href=\"/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)\" title=\"Rogue (video game)\">Rogue</a> on BSD Unix after two years of work, inspiring many <a href=\"/wiki/Roguelike\" title=\"Roguelike\">roguelike</a> games ever since. Like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)\" title=\"Dungeon (video game)\">Dungeon</a></i> on the PDP-10 and <i><a href=\"/wiki/Dnd_(video_game)\" title=\"Dnd (video game)\">dnd</a></i> on PLATO, <i>Rogue</i> displayed dungeon maps using text characters. Unlike those games, however, the dungeon was randomly generated for each play session, so the path to treasure and the enemies who protected it were different for each game. As the <i>Zork</i> team had done, <i>Rogue</i> was adapted for home computers and became a commercial product.</li> </ul> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Second_generation_consoles_.281977.E2.80.931983.29\">Second generation consoles (1977–1983)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_video_game_consoles_(second_generation)\" title=\"History of video game consoles (second generation)\">History of video game consoles (second generation)</a></div> <p>In the earliest consoles, the computing logic for one or more games was hardwired into microchips using <a href=\"/wiki/Logic_gate\" title=\"Logic gate\">discrete logic</a>, and no additional games could ever be added. In other words, these consoles were single-purpose computers, not programmable computers; there was no software, only hardware, so no change of software was possible. This was an obvious issue for developers; customers would have to buy a whole new device to attach to their TV sets in order to play different games. By the mid-1970s, game consoles contained general-purpose <a href=\"/wiki/Microprocessor\" title=\"Microprocessor\">microprocessors</a> and video games were found on <a href=\"/wiki/ROM_cartridge\" title=\"ROM cartridge\">cartridges</a>, starting in 1976 with the release of the <a href=\"/wiki/Fairchild_Channel_F\" title=\"Fairchild Channel F\">Fairchild Video Entertainment System (VES)</a>. Programs were burned onto <a href=\"/wiki/Read-only_memory\" title=\"Read-only memory\">ROM</a> chips (ICs) that were mounted inside plastic cartridge casings that could be plugged into slots on the game console. When the cartridges were plugged in, the ROM electrically became a part of the microcomputer in the console, just as if the ROM ICs were on the same circuit board with the microprocessor inside the console, and the microprocessor would execute whatever program was stored in the ROM. Rather than being confined to a small selection of games included in the game system, consumers could now amass libraries of game cartridges. However video game production was still a niche skill. Warren Robinett, the famous programmer of the game <a href=\"/wiki/Adventure_(1979_video_game)\" title=\"Adventure (1979 video game)\">Adventure</a>, spoke on developing games: \"In those old far-off days, each game for the 2600 was done entirely by one person, the programmer, who conceived the game concept, wrote the program, did the graphics—drawn first on graph paper and converted by hand to hexadecimal—and did the sounds.\"</p> <p>Three machines dominated the second generation of consoles in North America, far outselling their rivals:</p> <ul> <li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Atari_2600\" title=\"Atari 2600\">Video Computer System</a> (VCS) ROM cartridge-based console, later renamed the Atari 2600, was released in 1977 by Atari. Nine games were designed and released for the holiday season. While the console had a slow start, its port of the arcade game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Space_Invaders\" title=\"Space Invaders\">Space Invaders</a></i> would become the first \"<a href=\"/wiki/Killer_application\" title=\"Killer application\">killer app</a>\" and quadruple the console's sales. Soon after, the Atari 2600 would quickly become the most popular of all the early consoles prior to the <a href=\"/wiki/North_American_video_game_crash_of_1983\" title=\"North American video game crash of 1983\">North American video game crash of 1983</a>. Notably, the VCS did this with only an 8-bit 6507 CPU, 128 bytes (i.e. 0.125 KB) of RAM, and at most 4&nbsp;KB of ROM in each \"Game Program\"(tm) cartridge.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The <a href=\"/wiki/Intellivision\" title=\"Intellivision\">Intellivision</a>, introduced by <a href=\"/wiki/Mattel\" title=\"Mattel\">Mattel</a> in 1980. Though chronologically part of what is called the \"8-bit era\", the Intellivision had a unique processor with instructions that were 10 bits wide (allowing more instruction variety and potential speed), and registers 16 bits wide. The system, which featured graphics superior to the older Atari 2600, rocketed to popularity.</li> <li>The <a href=\"/wiki/ColecoVision\" title=\"ColecoVision\">ColecoVision</a>, an even more powerful machine, appeared in 1982. With its port of arcade game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(video_game)\" title=\"Donkey Kong (video game)\">Donkey Kong</a></i> included as a <a href=\"/wiki/Pack-in_game\" title=\"Pack-in game\">pack-in</a>, sales for this console also took off. However, the presence of three major consoles in the marketplace and a glut of poor quality games began to overcrowd retail shelves and erode consumers' interest in video games. Within a year, this overcrowded market would crash.</li> </ul> <p>In 1979, <a href=\"/wiki/Activision\" title=\"Activision\">Activision</a> was created by disgruntled former Atari programmers \"who realized that the games they had anonymously programmed on their $20K salaries were responsible for 60 percent of the company's $100 million in cartridge sales for one year\". It was the first <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_developer\" title=\"Video game developer\">third-party developer</a> of video games. By 1982, approximately 8 million American homes owned a video game console, and the home video game industry was generating an annual revenue of $3.8 billion, which was nearly half the $8 billion revenue in <a href=\"/wiki/Quarter_(United_States_coin)\" title=\"Quarter (United States coin)\">quarters</a> generated from the <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade video game</a> industry at the time.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games_.281978.E2.80.931986.29\">Golden age of arcade video games (1978–1986)</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games\" title=\"Golden age of arcade video games\">Golden age of arcade video games</a></div> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade game</a> industry entered its <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_age_(metaphor)\" title=\"Golden age (metaphor)\">golden age</a> in 1978 with the release of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Space_Invaders\" title=\"Space Invaders\">Space Invaders</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Taito_Corporation\" title=\"Taito Corporation\">Taito</a>, a success that inspired dozens of manufacturers to enter the market.

As of 2015, there are eight generations of video game consoles, with the latest generation including Nintendo's \"Wii U\" , Microsoft's \"Xbox One\" , and Sony's \"PlayStation 4\".</p> <p></p> <p></p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Early_history\">Early history</span></h2> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/First_video_game\" title=\"First video game\">First video game</a></div> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Origins_of_the_computer_game_.281940.E2.80.931970.29\">Origins of the computer game (1940–1970)</span></h3> <p>The earliest video games, by the popular and most all-encompassing definition of an interactive program incorporating both electronics and a display, developed as an outgrowth of computer research in fields such as <a href=\"/wiki/Artificial_intelligence\" title=\"Artificial intelligence\">artificial intelligence</a>. As computer technology evolved through the 1940s from the <a href=\"/wiki/Electromechanical\" title=\"Electromechanical\" class=\"mw-redirect\">electromechanical</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Z3_(computer)\" title=\"Z3 (computer)\">Z3</a> (1941) to the <a href=\"/wiki/Electronics\" title=\"Electronics\">electronic</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Atanasoff%E2%80%93Berry_Computer\" title=\"Atanasoff–Berry Computer\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Atanasoff–Berry Computer</a> (1942) to the <a href=\"/wiki/Turing_completeness\" title=\"Turing completeness\">Turing-complete</a> <a href=\"/wiki/ENIAC\" title=\"ENIAC\">ENIAC</a> (1945) and finally to the <a href=\"/wiki/Stored-program_computer\" title=\"Stored-program computer\">stored-program</a> <a href=\"/wiki/EDSAC\" title=\"EDSAC\" class=\"mw-redirect\">EDSAC</a> (1949), computers became both powerful and flexible enough to serve a variety of scientific and business functions. In 1951, the computer was commercialized in the United States by the <a href=\"/wiki/UNIVAC\" title=\"UNIVAC\">UNIVAC</a> division of typewriter company <a href=\"/wiki/Remington_Rand\" title=\"Remington Rand\">Remington Rand</a>, paving the way for the adoption of the <a href=\"/wiki/Mainframe_computer\" title=\"Mainframe computer\">mainframe</a> by academic institutions, research organizations, and corporations across the developed world. Adoption of computer technology was initially limited to only the largest such organizations, however, by prohibitive cost, expansive space requirements, enormous power consumption, and the need to employ a highly trained staff to maintain and operate the machines. This created an environment in which every second of computer use needed to be justified as part of a serious scientific or business endeavor. Early game creation was thus largely limited to testing or demonstrating theories relating to areas such as human-computer interaction, <a href=\"/wiki/Adaptive_learning\" title=\"Adaptive learning\">adaptive learning</a>, and military strategy.</p> <p>Due to the haphazard nature of early computer game creation and the lack of concern for preservation at the time, it is difficult to pinpoint the first video game ever created. Some of the earliest known games include <a href=\"/wiki/Bertie_the_Brain\" title=\"Bertie the Brain\">Bertie the Brain</a> (1950), a tic-tac-toe game on display at the <a href=\"/wiki/Canadian_National_Exhibition\" title=\"Canadian National Exhibition\">Canadian National Exhibition</a>; the <a href=\"/wiki/Nimrod_(computing)\" title=\"Nimrod (computing)\">Nimrod</a> (1951), a computer custom-built by <a href=\"/wiki/Ferranti\" title=\"Ferranti\">Ferranti</a> specifically for display at the <a href=\"/wiki/Festival_of_Britain\" title=\"Festival of Britain\">Festival of Britain</a> that could play the mathematical game <a href=\"/wiki/Nim\" title=\"Nim\">Nim</a>; <i><a href=\"/wiki/OXO\" title=\"OXO\">OXO</a></i> by <a href=\"/wiki/Sandy_Douglas\" title=\"Sandy Douglas\">A.S. Douglas</a> (1952), which he programmed as part of his master's thesis and is the earliest known game to display graphics on a monitor; <i>Hutspiel</i> (1955), a war game built by the <a href=\"/wiki/United_States\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> military to simulate a conflict with the <a href=\"/wiki/Soviet_Union\" title=\"Soviet Union\">Soviet Union</a> in <a href=\"/wiki/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">Europe</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/IBM\" title=\"IBM\">IBM</a> employee <a href=\"/wiki/Arthur_Samuel\" title=\"Arthur Samuel\">Arthur Samuel</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Checkers\" title=\"Checkers\" class=\"mw-redirect\">checkers</a> program (1956), one of the earliest computer games demonstrated on national television in the United States and eventually capable of self-improvement through analyzing mistakes in its own play; and the <a href=\"/wiki/History_of_computer_chess\" title=\"History of computer chess\" class=\"mw-redirect\">NSS Chess Program</a> developed at <a href=\"/wiki/Carnegie_Mellon_University\" title=\"Carnegie Mellon University\">Carnegie Mellon University</a> (1958), the first chess program sophisticated enough to defeat a novice human opponent.</p> <p>One program that stands out in this early period — both for its atypical subject matter and its subsequent notoriety in a series of patent lawsuits — is <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tennis_for_Two\" title=\"Tennis for Two\">Tennis for Two</a></i> (1958), created by physicist <a href=\"/wiki/William_Higinbotham\" title=\"William Higinbotham\">William Higinbotham</a> to entertain guests at the annual visitor's day held by the <a href=\"/wiki/Brookhaven_National_Laboratory\" title=\"Brookhaven National Laboratory\">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a>. This program displayed a tennis court in side view on an <a href=\"/wiki/Oscilloscope\" title=\"Oscilloscope\">oscilloscope</a> and allowed two players to volley a ball using box-shaped controllers equipped with a knob for <a href=\"/wiki/Trajectory\" title=\"Trajectory\">trajectory</a> and a button for hitting the ball. Displayed for two seasons at Brookhaven, <i>Tennis for Two</i> proved popular with the public, but was ultimately dismantled so its parts could be re-purposed for other tasks. Higinbotham never considered adapting the successful game into a commercial product. Like the other game creators in the 1950s, his focus remained on research rather than entertainment. Ultimately, the widespread adoption of computers to play games had to wait for the machines to spread from serious academics to their students on U.S. college campuses.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Spacewar.21\"><i>Spacewar!</i></span></h3> <p>By 1960, the <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> (MIT) was one of the premiere centers of computer research in the world, home to both the <a href=\"/wiki/Lincoln_Laboratory\" title=\"Lincoln Laboratory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Lincoln Laboratory</a> and the <a href=\"/wiki/MIT_Computer_Science_and_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory\" title=\"MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\">Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a>. The former provided MIT with a custom-built <a href=\"/wiki/Transistor\" title=\"Transistor\">transistorized</a> computer, the <a href=\"/wiki/TX-0\" title=\"TX-0\">TX-0</a>, that was both smaller and more interactive than the typical mainframe, while the latter provided the institution with <a href=\"/wiki/Steve_Russell\" title=\"Steve Russell\">Steve Russell</a>, who followed Artificial Intelligence Lab founder <a href=\"/wiki/John_McCarthy_(computer_scientist)\" title=\"John McCarthy (computer scientist)\">John McCarthy</a> from <a href=\"/wiki/Dartmouth_College\" title=\"Dartmouth College\">Dartmouth College</a> to MIT in 1958 to help him develop the <a href=\"/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\" title=\"Lisp (programming language)\">LISP</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Programming_language\" title=\"Programming language\">programming language</a>. The TX-0 operated under fewer restrictions than MIT's more powerful IBM mainframes and could actually be operated by students during off-peak hours in the middle of the night. The computer soon attracted a group of engineering undergrads with membership in a student organization called the <a href=\"/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club\" title=\"Tech Model Railroad Club\">Tech Model Railroad Club</a> (TMRC) who referred to themselves as \"<a href=\"/wiki/Hacker_(programmer_subculture)\" title=\"Hacker (programmer subculture)\">hackers</a>\" after the word \"hack\" members of the club had defined to describe a particularly clever feat of ingenuity. Soon, <a href=\"/wiki/Alan_Kotok\" title=\"Alan Kotok\">Alan Kotok</a>, Bob Saunders, Peter Sampson and other hackers were spending their nights punching out computer code on paper tape to create improved programming tools, music programs, and simple AI routines like <a href=\"/wiki/First_video_game#1959:_Mouse_in_the_Maze.2C_Tic-Tac-Toe\" title=\"First video game\">Mouse in a Maze</a> and a <a href=\"/wiki/Tic-tac-toe\" title=\"Tic-tac-toe\">Tic-tac-toe</a> program.</p> <p>Steve Russell and his friends Martin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen were attracted to the TX-0 as well, which in 1961 was joined by a <a href=\"/wiki/PDP-1\" title=\"PDP-1\">PDP-1</a> from the <a href=\"/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation\" title=\"Digital Equipment Corporation\">Digital Equipment Corporation</a>, a computer company established by former Lincoln Laboratory engineers. Equipped with a high-quality <a href=\"/wiki/Vector_monitor\" title=\"Vector monitor\">vector display</a>, the PDP-1 offered the promise of more sophisticated visual hacks than the aging TX-0. Russell and friends, who were great fans of the science fiction novels of <a href=\"/wiki/E.E._Smith\" title=\"E.E. Smith\" class=\"mw-redirect\">E.E. Smith</a>, decided to exploit the new hardware by creating a game in which two human-controlled spaceships attempted to destroy each other by firing torpedoes. Dubbed <i><a href=\"/wiki/Spacewar_(video_game)\" title=\"Spacewar (video game)\">Spacewar!</a></i> (1962), this hack, programmed primarily by Russell with several crucial enhancements from members of the TMRC, became one of the first computer games to achieve national distribution when DEC decided to include it as a test program on every PDP-1 it sold. By the end of the 1960s, <i>Spacewar!</i> could be found in university computer labs across the United States and served as an inspiration for students to create their own variations of the game alongside entirely new designs. These creations remained trapped in the lab for the remainder of the decade, however, because even though some adherents of <i>Spacewar!</i> had begun to sense its commercial possibilities, it could only run on hardware costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. As computers and their components continued to fall in price, however, the dream of a commercial video game finally became attainable at the beginning by the 1970s.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Nolan_Bushnell_and_the_commercialization_of_the_video_game\">Nolan Bushnell and the commercialization of the video game</span></h3> <p>Even in 1971, the components for a system capable of running a program with the sophistication of <i>Spacewar!</i> were too expensive to transform the game into home entertainment. A new generation of <a href=\"/wiki/Minicomputer\" title=\"Minicomputer\">minicomputers</a> like the <a href=\"/wiki/Data_General\" title=\"Data General\">Data General</a> <a href=\"/wiki/Data_General_Nova\" title=\"Data General Nova\">Nova</a> and the DEC <a href=\"/wiki/PDP-11\" title=\"PDP-11\">PDP-11</a> debuted in 1969-70, however, that dropped the price of computing low enough that it could seriously be considered for the coin-operated games industry, which at the time was experiencing its own technological renaissance as large electro-mechanical driving and target shooting games like <a href=\"/wiki/Sega\" title=\"Sega\">Sega Enterprises</a>'s <i>Periscope</i> (1967) and <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago_Coin\" title=\"Chicago Coin\">Chicago Coin</a>'s <i>Speedway</i> (1968) pioneered the adoption of elaborate visual displays and electronic sound effects in the <a href=\"/wiki/Amusement_arcade\" title=\"Amusement arcade\">amusement arcade</a>. While this coin-op industry was controlled almost exclusively by a group of established firms in <a href=\"/wiki/Chicago\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago</a>, the promise of integrating solid-state components like <a href=\"/wiki/Integrated_circuit\" title=\"Integrated circuit\">integrated circuits</a> into coin-operated games attracted a small number of engineers and entrepreneurs in <a href=\"/wiki/California\" title=\"California\">California</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Silicon_Valley\" title=\"Silicon Valley\">Silicon Valley</a>, where the first commercial video game products would be introduced.</p> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Nolan_Bushnell\" title=\"Nolan Bushnell\">Nolan Bushnell</a> stood uniquely between the worlds of coin-op and computers that would join forces to introduce the video game to the general public. As an electrical engineering student at the <a href=\"/wiki/University_of_Utah\" title=\"University of Utah\">University of Utah</a> in the mid-1960s, Bushnell received limited exposure to computer programming through his classes while gaining work experience maintaining the coin-operated games at the <a href=\"/wiki/Lagoon_(amusement_park)\" title=\"Lagoon (amusement park)\">Lagoon Amusement Park</a>. Upon graduation, Bushnell found employment at <a href=\"/wiki/Ampex\" title=\"Ampex\">Ampex</a> in Silicon Valley, where he was soon exposed to the <i>Spacewar!</i> game at the <a href=\"/wiki/Stanford_Artificial_Intelligence_Laboratory\" title=\"Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</a> (SAIL). Already possessed of an entrepreneurial streak, Bushnell immediately looked for a commercial avenue for the game and had the idea of developing a coin-operated version on a minicomputer like the Nova. Enlisting his office mate at Ampex, an older and more experienced engineer named <a href=\"/wiki/Ted_Dabney\" title=\"Ted Dabney\">Ted Dabney</a>, Bushnell orchestrated the creation of a partnership called <a href=\"/wiki/Atari,_Inc.\" title=\"Atari, Inc.\">Syzygy Engineering</a> to develop the game. Using a minicomputer proved prohibitively expensive, however, so Bushnell hit on a new concept of controlling the <a href=\"/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube\" title=\"Cathode ray tube\">cathode ray tube</a> of a television through <a href=\"/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic\" title=\"Transistor–transistor logic\">transistor–transistor logic</a> (TTL) circuits to generate and move dots around the screen. This conceptual breakthrough, which was actually implemented by Dabney, allowed the duo to create a take-off on <i>Spacewar!</i> called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Computer_Space\" title=\"Computer Space\">Computer Space</a></i>, in which the player controls a spaceship and attempts to destroy two hardware-controlled flying saucers before they destroy him.</p> <p>Released in 1971 by one of the few Silicon Valley coin-op companies, <a href=\"/wiki/Nutting_Associates\" title=\"Nutting Associates\">Nutting Associates</a>, <i>Computer Space</i> failed to sell its entire production run due to several factors including marketing blunders by Nutting and an overly complicated physics system and control scheme that alienated the working-class bar patrons that were the primary market for coin-operated games at the time. Meanwhile, a second attempt to bring <i>Spacewar!</i> into the arcade market called <i><a href=\"/wiki/Galaxy_Game\" title=\"Galaxy Game\">Galaxy Game</a></i> by Hugh Pitts and Stan Tuck that began market testing at roughly the same time as <i>Computer Space</i> failed to even expand beyond its initial location, as Pitts took the route Bushnell rejected of recreating Steve Russell's landmark hack on a <a href=\"/wiki/PDP-11\" title=\"PDP-11\">PDP-11</a>, resulting in a product that was too expensive for mass production. Both <i>Computer Space</i> and <i>Galaxy Game</i> proved popular with the sophisticated engineering crowd centered around <a href=\"/wiki/Stanford_University\" title=\"Stanford University\">Stanford University</a>, but in order to gain mass market acceptance, the video game would have to evolve to be both cheaper and simpler to play.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ralph_Baer_and_the_birth_of_home_consoles\">Ralph Baer and the birth of home consoles</span></h3> <p>The seeds of a commercially successful video game industry were not sown in Silicon Valley, but in far away <a href=\"/wiki/Nashua,_New_Hampshire\" title=\"Nashua, New Hampshire\">Nashua, New Hampshire</a>, at military contractor <a href=\"/wiki/Sanders_Associates\" title=\"Sanders Associates\">Sanders Associates</a>. It was at Sanders that <a href=\"/wiki/Ralph_H._Baer\" title=\"Ralph H. Baer\">Ralph Baer</a>, the head of the company's instrumentation division, began a skunk works project in 1966 with a small group of engineers to create an interactive game playable on a television set. A graduate of the American Television Institute of Technology with a degree in television engineering, Baer had long been interested in evolving television entertainment beyond passive network programming and had almost implemented a built-in game on a television he was designing for <a href=\"/wiki/Loral_Corporation\" title=\"Loral Corporation\">Loral Corporation</a> back in 1951 before his boss told him to abandon the concept. Now over a decade later, he was inspired to try again. Working primarily with co-worker Bill Harrison, who built most of the actual hardware, Baer developed a series of prototype systems based on diode-transistor (DTL) logic circuits that would send a video signal to a television set to generate spots on the screen that could be controlled by the player. These spots were used to play a variety of simple button-mashing, quiz, and chase games as well as a target shooting game using a light gun. Originally capable of generating only two spots, the system was modified in November 1967 at the suggestion of engineer Bill Rusch to generate a third spot for use in a ping pong game in which each player controlled a single spot that served as a paddle and volleyed the third spot, which acted as a ball.</p> <p>As a defense contractor struggling in a recession, Sanders Associates was in no position to launch a consumer product, but management saw enough potential in the Baer prototype to allow him to attempt to find a manufacturing partner. This proved to be a difficult prospect, as no company involved in the television industry had ever shown much interest in interactive entertainment. Indeed, the only known previous attempt by a television company to use a CRT for a game, a <a href=\"/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube_amusement_device\" title=\"Cathode ray tube amusement device\">cathode ray tube amusement device</a> developed in 1947 by <a href=\"/wiki/DuMont_Laboratories\" title=\"DuMont Laboratories\">DuMont Laboratories</a> and sometimes erroneously credited as the first video game concept despite not incorporating a computer, a video signal, or a monitor, was abandoned without ever entering production. After being turned down by cable company <a href=\"/wiki/TelePrompTer_Corporation\" title=\"TelePrompTer Corporation\">TelePrompTer Corporation</a>, Baer approached every important television manufacturer in the United States, but received only a lukewarm response. After rejecting an offer from <a href=\"/wiki/RCA\" title=\"RCA\">RCA</a> due to what Sanders considered unreasonable terms, the company entered an agreement to license the system to <a href=\"/wiki/Magnavox\" title=\"Magnavox\">Magnavox</a> in 1971.</p> <p>Released as the <a href=\"/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey\" title=\"Magnavox Odyssey\">Magnavox Odyssey</a> in 1972, Baer's system represented both the first home console system and the first actual video game by the original and legal definition of the term as an apparatus that transmits a video signal to a television receiver for the purpose of generating images that can be manipulated by individuals to play a game. The system launched with a dozen included games in the box, four more sold with a separate light gun, and six games sold separately. These games were largely variations on the quiz, chase, shooting, and ball-and-paddle games conceived by Baer and his team and made use of screen overlays and accessories such as cards and dice that were also included with the system for additional graphical and gameplay elements. While the games were activated using individual circuit cards inserted into the system, these devices did not contain memory and merely unlocked games already wired into the hardware.",

As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the \"one-man shop\" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets, where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited <a href=\"/wiki/RAM\" title=\"RAM\" class=\"mw-redirect\">RAM</a> or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some cellphones and <a href=\"/wiki/PDAs\" title=\"PDAs\" class=\"mw-redirect\">PDAs</a>).</p> <p>With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Downloadable_content\">Downloadable content</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Downloadable_content\" title=\"Downloadable content\">Downloadable content</a></div> <p>A phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC).

The two most visible schools in this emerging field are <a href=\"/wiki/Ludology\" title=\"Ludology\" class=\"mw-redirect\">ludology</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Narratology\" title=\"Narratology\">narratology</a>. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what <a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Murray\" title=\"Janet Murray\">Janet Murray</a> calls \"Cyberdrama\". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video games in the context of the <a href=\"/wiki/Holodeck\" title=\"Holodeck\">Holodeck</a>, a fictional piece of technology from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek\" title=\"Star Trek\">Star Trek</a></i>, arguing for the video game as a medium in which we get to become another person, and to act out in another world. This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tron\" title=\"Tron\">Tron</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/EXistenZ\" title=\"EXistenZ\" class=\"mw-redirect\">eXistenZ</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Last_Starfighter\" title=\"The Last Starfighter\">The Last Starfighter</a></i>.</p> <p>Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. <a href=\"/wiki/Espen_J._Aarseth\" title=\"Espen J. Aarseth\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Espen J. Aarseth</a> argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tomb_Raider\" title=\"Tomb Raider\">Tomb Raider</a></i>, saying that \"the dimensions of <a href=\"/wiki/Lara_Croft\" title=\"Lara Croft\">Lara Croft</a>'s body, already analyzed to death by <a href=\"/wiki/Film_theory\" title=\"Film theory\">film theorists</a>, are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.\" Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.</p> <p>While many games rely on <a href=\"/wiki/Emergence\" title=\"Emergence\">emergent principles</a>, video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game. The term \"emergent narrative\" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by \"what happens to the player.\" However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for <a href=\"/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence\" title=\"Artificial Intelligence\" class=\"mw-redirect\">AI</a> in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_aspects\">Social aspects</span></h2> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Women_and_video_games\" title=\"Women and video games\">Women and video games</a></div> <p>The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, taking a survey of 2,000 regular <a href=\"/wiki/Gamer\" title=\"Gamer\">gamers</a>, found that the U.S. games market is diversifying. The age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25–40 age group. For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games, the gender divide is more or less equal between males and females. Females have also been found to show an attraction to online multi-player games where there is a communal experience. More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/First-person_shooter\" title=\"First-person shooter\">first-person shooters</a>). According to the ESRB almost 41% of PC gamers are women</p> <p>When comparing today's industry climate with that of 20 years ago, women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry. While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market, it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth. The <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Association\" title=\"Entertainment Software Association\">Entertainment Software Association</a> (ESA) provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1,200 American households carried out by Ipsos MediaCT:</p> <ul> <li>The average gamer is 30 years old and has been playing for 12 years. Eighty-two percent of gamers are 18 years of age or older.</li> <li>Forty-two percent of all players are women and women over 18 years of age are one of the industry's fastest growing demographics.</li> <li>Today, adult women represent a greater portion of the game-playing population (37 percent) than boys age 17 or younger (13 percent).</li> <li>Twenty-nine percent of game players are over the age of 50, an increase from nine percent in 1999.</li> <li>Sixty-five percent of gamers play games with other gamers in person.</li> <li>Fifty-five percent of gamers play games on their phones or handheld device.</li> </ul> <p>A 2006 academic study, based on a survey answered by 10,000 gamers, identified the <a href=\"/wiki/Gaymer\" title=\"Gaymer\">gaymers</a> (gamers that identify as gay) as a demographic group. A follow-up survey in 2009 studied the purchase habits and content preferences of people in the group.</p> <p>Based on the study by NPD group in 2011, approximately 91 percent of children aged 2–17 play games.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multiplayer\">Multiplayer</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game\" title=\"Multiplayer video game\">Multiplayer video game</a></div> <p>Video gaming has traditionally been a social experience. <a href=\"/wiki/Multiplayer_game\" title=\"Multiplayer game\">Multiplayer video games</a> are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Sports\" title=\"Electronic Sports\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Electronic Sports</a>, or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by <a href=\"/wiki/Hotseat_(multiplayer_mode)\" title=\"Hotseat (multiplayer mode)\">hotseating</a>. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tennis_for_Two\" title=\"Tennis for Two\">Tennis for Two</a></i>, arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pong\" title=\"Pong\">Pong</a></i>. The first commercially available game console, the <a href=\"/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey\" title=\"Magnavox Odyssey\">Magnavox Odyssey</a>, had two controller inputs.</p> <p>Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Multitap\" title=\"Multitap\">Multitap</a>. Multiplayer <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade games</a> typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.</p> <p>Many early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from <a href=\"/wiki/Atari\" title=\"Atari\">Atari</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_International\" title=\"Commodore International\">Commodore</a> both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or <a href=\"/wiki/MUD\" title=\"MUD\">MUDs</a> that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread <a href=\"/wiki/Local_area_network\" title=\"Local area network\">local area networking</a> technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. <a href=\"/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game\" title=\"Massively multiplayer online game\">MMOs</a> can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; <i><a href=\"/wiki/Eve_Online\" title=\"Eve Online\">Eve Online</a></i> set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Behavioral_effects\">Behavioral effects</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_behavioral_effects\" title=\"Video game behavioral effects\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Video game behavioral effects</a></div> <p>It has been shown that action video game players have better <a href=\"/wiki/Hand%E2%80%93eye_coordination\" title=\"Hand–eye coordination\" class=\"mw-redirect\">hand–eye coordination</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Motor_coordination\" title=\"Motor coordination\">visuo-motor skills</a>, such as their resistance to <a href=\"/wiki/Distraction\" title=\"Distraction\">distraction</a>, their sensitivity to information in the <a href=\"/wiki/Peripheral_vision\" title=\"Peripheral vision\">peripheral vision</a> and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.</p> <p>Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects. It has been suggested by a few studies that online/offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns.</p> <p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Steven_Berlin_Johnson\" title=\"Steven Berlin Johnson\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Steven Johnson</a>'s book, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Everything_Bad_Is_Good_for_You\" title=\"Everything Bad Is Good for You\">Everything Bad Is Good for You</a></i>, he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\" title=\"Monopoly (game)\">Monopoly</a></i>. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and <a href=\"/wiki/HUD_(computer_gaming)\" title=\"HUD (computer gaming)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">HUDs</a>. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.</p> <p>Learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system. It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits. Students are found to be \"learning by doing\" while playing video games while fostering creative thinking.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Army\" title=\"United States Army\">U.S. Army</a> has deployed machines such as the <a href=\"/wiki/PackBot\" title=\"PackBot\">PackBot</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/UAV\" title=\"UAV\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UAV</a> vehicles, which make use of a game-style <a href=\"/wiki/Game_controller\" title=\"Game controller\">hand controller</a> to make it more familiar for young people.</p> <p>According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' <a href=\"/wiki/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\" class=\"mw-redirect\">dexterity</a> as well as their ability to problem-solve. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.</p> <p>The research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups. In addition, many of the studies are <a href=\"/wiki/Cross-sectional\" title=\"Cross-sectional\" class=\"mw-redirect\">cross-sectional</a>, and of the <a href=\"/wiki/Longitudinal_study\" title=\"Longitudinal study\">longitudinal</a> interventional trials, not all have found effects. A response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as mental rotation, which is not a common task in action games.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Controversy\">Controversy</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_controversy\" title=\"Video game controversy\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Video game controversy</a></div> <p>Like related forms of media, computer and video games have been the subject of frequent controversy and censorship, due to the depiction of graphic violence, <a href=\"/wiki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">sexual themes</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Advergaming\" title=\"Advergaming\" class=\"mw-redirect\">advertisement</a>, consumption of <a href=\"/wiki/Recreational_drug_use\" title=\"Recreational drug use\">drugs</a>, consumption of <a href=\"/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage\" title=\"Alcoholic beverage\">alcohol</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Tobacco\" title=\"Tobacco\">tobacco</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Propaganda\" title=\"Propaganda\">propaganda</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Profanity\" title=\"Profanity\">profanity</a> in some games. Among others, critics of video games often include parents' groups, politicians, organized religious groups, and other <a href=\"/wiki/Advocacy_group\" title=\"Advocacy group\">advocacy groups</a>. Various games have been accused of causing <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_addiction\" title=\"Video game addiction\">addiction</a> and even violent behavior, though how much ground this holds is debatable. \"Video game censorship\" is defined as the use of state or group power to control the playing, distribution, purchase, or sale of video games or computer games. Video game controversy comes in many forms, and censorship is a controversial subject. Proponents and opponents of censorship are often very passionate about their individual views. However, there has not been substantial evidence against or in favor of showing a positive correlation between video games and acts such as killing.</p> <p>Various national content rating organizations, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) in North America, rate software for certain age groups and with certain content warnings. Some of these organizations are optional industry self-regulation (such as the ESRB), while others are part of national government censorship organizations (such as the <a href=\"/wiki/BBFC\" title=\"BBFC\" class=\"mw-redirect\">BBFC</a>). Most video games display their rating on the front side of their packaging. However, parents are not always aware of the existence of these ratings. Not all ratings are considered accurate. Organizations such as <i>What They Play</i> and <i>Common Sense Media</i> aim to provide guidance and advice for parents.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ratings_and_censorship\">Ratings and censorship</span></h2> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ESRB\">ESRB</span></h3> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) gives video games maturity ratings based on their content. For example, a game might be rated <i>T</i> for <i>Teen</i> if the game contained obscene words or violence. If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes, it is likely to receive an <i>M</i> for <i>Mature</i> rating, which means that no one under 17 should play it. There is a rated \"A/O\" games for \"Adults Only\" these games have massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing \"M\" rated games in the United States.

However, many stores have opted to not sell such games to children anyway. Of course, video game laws vary from country to country. One of the most controversial games of all time, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Manhunt_2\" title=\"Manhunt 2\">Manhunt 2</a></i> by Rockstar Studios, was given an <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board#Restricted_ratings\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">AO rating</a> by the ESRB until Rockstar could make the content more suitable for a mature audience.</p> <p>Video game manufacturers usually exercise tight control over the games that are made available on their systems, so unusual or special-interest games are more likely to appear as <a href=\"/wiki/PC_games\" title=\"PC games\" class=\"mw-redirect\">PC games</a>. Free, casual, and <a href=\"/wiki/Browser-based_game\" title=\"Browser-based game\" class=\"mw-redirect\">browser-based games</a> are usually played on available computers, mobile phones, or <a href=\"/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant\" title=\"Personal digital assistant\">PDAs</a>.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PEGI\">PEGI</span></h3> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Pan_European_Game_Information\" title=\"Pan European Game Information\">Pan European Game Information</a> (PEGI) is a system that was developed to standardize the game ratings in all of Europe (not just <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a>, although the majority are EU members), the current members are: all EU members, except Germany and the 10 accession states; <a href=\"/wiki/Norway\" title=\"Norway\">Norway</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/Switzerland\" title=\"Switzerland\">Switzerland</a>. Iceland is expected to join soon, as are the 10 EU accession states. For all PEGI members, they use it as their sole system, with the exception of the UK, where if a game contains certain material, it must be rated by <a href=\"/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification\" title=\"British Board of Film Classification\">BBFC</a>.

Another growing factor that is difficult to account for is the expansion and popularity of <a href=\"/wiki/Indie_games\" title=\"Indie games\" class=\"mw-redirect\">independent games</a>, which typically bypass traditional developer/publisher relationships to instead market directly to the consumer.</p> <p>These figures are sales in dollars, not units, Unit shipments for each category were higher than the dollar sales numbers indicate, because more software and hardware was discounted than in 2003. But with the release of the next-generation consoles in 2006, these numbers increased dramatically. The game and film industries are also becoming increasingly intertwined, with companies like <a href=\"/wiki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a> having significant stakes in both. A large number of summer blockbuster films spawn a companion game, often launching at the same time to share the marketing costs.</p> <p>The global market for console games has seen an average of 6.9 percent compound annual growth rate and is expected to become a $34.7 billion market in 2012.Online game sales are expected to grow at a larger rate of 16.9 percent, escalating from $6.6 billion in 2008 to $14.4 billion by 2012.

Because genres are dependent on content for definition, genres have changed and evolved as newer styles of video games have come into existence. Ever advancing technology and production values related to video game development have fostered more lifelike and complex games which have in turn introduced or enhanced genre possibilities (e.g., virtual pets), pushed the boundaries of existing video gaming or in some cases add new possibilities in play (such as that seen with titles specifically designed for devices like Sony's <a href=\"/wiki/PlayStation_Eye\" title=\"PlayStation Eye\">EyeToy</a>). Some genres represent combinations of others, such as <a href=\"/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game\" title=\"Massively multiplayer online role-playing game\">massively multiplayer online role-playing games</a>, or, more commonly, MMORPGs. It is also common to see higher level genre terms that are collective in nature across all other genres such as with action, music/rhythm or horror-themed video games.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Classifications\">Classifications</span></h3> <h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Casual_games\">Casual games</span></h4> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Casual_game\" title=\"Casual game\">Casual game</a></div> <p>Casual games derive their name from their ease of accessibility, simple to understand gameplay and quick to grasp rule sets. Additionally, casual games frequently support the ability to jump in and out of play on demand. Casual games as a format existed long before the term was coined and include video games such as Solitaire or Minesweeper which can commonly be found pre-installed with many versions of the <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft_Windows\" title=\"Microsoft Windows\">Microsoft Windows</a> operating system.</p> <p>Examples of genres within this category are <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_genres#Casual_gaming_genres\" title=\"Video game genres\" class=\"mw-redirect\">hidden object</a>, match three, time management, tetris or many of the <a href=\"/wiki/Tower_defense\" title=\"Tower defense\">tower defense</a> style games.

Some serious games may even fail to qualify as a video game in the traditional sense of the term. Educational software does not typically fall under this category (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/Touch_typing\" title=\"Touch typing\">touch typing</a> tutors, language learning, etc.) and the primary distinction would appear to be based on the title's primary goal as well as target age demographics. As with the other categories, this description is more of a guideline than a rule.</p> <p>Serious games are games generally made for reasons beyond simple entertainment and as with the core and casual games may include works from any given genre, although some such as <a href=\"/wiki/Exergaming\" title=\"Exergaming\">exergames</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Educational_game\" title=\"Educational game\">educational games</a>, or propaganda games may have a higher representation in this group due to their subject matter. These games are typically designed to be played by professionals as part of a specific job or for skill set improvement. They can also be created to convey social-political awareness on a specific subject.</p> <p>One of the longest running serious games franchises would be <a href=\"/wiki/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator\" title=\"Microsoft Flight Simulator\">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> first published in 1982 under that name. The United States military uses virtual reality based simulations, such as <a href=\"/wiki/VBS1\" title=\"VBS1\">VBS1</a> for training exercises, as do a growing number of first responder roles (e.g., police, fire fighter, EMT). One example of a non-game environment utilized as a platform for serious game development would be the virtual world of <i><a href=\"/wiki/Second_Life\" title=\"Second Life\">Second Life</a></i>, which is currently used by several United States governmental departments (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration\" title=\"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\">NOAA</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/NASA\" title=\"NASA\">NASA</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory\" title=\"Jet Propulsion Laboratory\">JPL</a>), Universities (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/Ohio_University\" title=\"Ohio University\">Ohio University</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology\" title=\"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\">MIT</a>) for educational and remote learning programs and businesses (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/IBM\" title=\"IBM\">IBM</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Cisco_Systems\" title=\"Cisco Systems\">Cisco Systems</a>) for meetings and training.</p> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Tactical_media\" title=\"Tactical media\">Tactical media</a> in video games plays a crucial role in making a statement or conveying a message on important relevant issues. This form of media allows for a broader audience to be able to receive and gain access to certain information that otherwise may not have reached such people. An example of tactical media in video games would be <a href=\"/wiki/Newsgame\" title=\"Newsgame\">newsgames</a>. These are short games related to contemporary events designed to illustrate a point. For example, Take Action Games is a game studio collective that was co-founded by Susana Ruiz and has made successful serious games. Some of these games include <i><a href=\"/wiki/Darfur_is_Dying\" title=\"Darfur is Dying\">Darfur is Dying</a></i>, <i>Finding Zoe</i>, and <i>In The Balance</i>.

This campaign states that it plans to harness the power of interactive games to help achieve the goal of students excelling in these departments. This campaign has stemmed into many new opportunities for the video game realm and has contributed to many new competitions. Some of these competitions include the Stem National Video Game Competition and the <a href=\"/wiki/Imagine_Cup\" title=\"Imagine Cup\">Imagine Cup</a>. Both of these examples are events that bring a focus to relevant and important current issues that are able to be addressed in the sense of video games to educate and spread knowledge in a new form of media. www.NobelPrize.org uses games to entice the user to learn about information pertaining to the Nobel prize achievements while engaging in a fun to play video game. There are many different types and styles of educational games all the way from counting to spelling to games for kids and games for adults. Some other games do not have any particular targeted audience in mind and intended to simply educate or inform whoever views or plays the game.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Development\">Development</span></h2> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Game_development\" title=\"Game development\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Game development</a></div> <div class=\"hatnote boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_industry_practices\" title=\"Video game industry practices\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Video game industry practices</a></div> <p>Video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_developer\" title=\"Video game developer\">Video game developers</a>, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include <a href=\"/wiki/Game_programmer\" title=\"Game programmer\">programmers</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Graphic_design\" title=\"Graphic design\">graphic designers</a>. Over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including <a href=\"/wiki/Sound_design\" title=\"Sound design\">sound designers</a>, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Game_designer\" title=\"Game designer\" class=\"mw-redirect\">game designer</a>. All of these are managed by <a href=\"/wiki/Game_producer\" title=\"Game producer\" class=\"mw-redirect\">producers</a>.</p> <p>In the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. As platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. This is not to say that the age of the \"one-man shop\" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets, where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited <a href=\"/wiki/RAM\" title=\"RAM\" class=\"mw-redirect\">RAM</a> or lack of dedicated 3D graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform (e.g., some cellphones and <a href=\"/wiki/PDAs\" title=\"PDAs\" class=\"mw-redirect\">PDAs</a>).</p> <p>With the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Downloadable_content\">Downloadable content</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Downloadable_content\" title=\"Downloadable content\">Downloadable content</a></div> <p>A phenomenon of additional game content at a later date, often for additional funds, began with digital video game distribution known as downloadable content (DLC).

The two most visible schools in this emerging field are <a href=\"/wiki/Ludology\" title=\"Ludology\" class=\"mw-redirect\">ludology</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Narratology\" title=\"Narratology\">narratology</a>. Narrativists approach video games in the context of what <a href=\"/wiki/Janet_Murray\" title=\"Janet Murray\">Janet Murray</a> calls \"Cyberdrama\". That is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of interactive fiction. Murray puts video games in the context of the <a href=\"/wiki/Holodeck\" title=\"Holodeck\">Holodeck</a>, a fictional piece of technology from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Star_Trek\" title=\"Star Trek\">Star Trek</a></i>, arguing for the video game as a medium in which we get to become another person, and to act out in another world. This image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tron\" title=\"Tron\">Tron</a></i>, <i><a href=\"/wiki/EXistenZ\" title=\"EXistenZ\" class=\"mw-redirect\">eXistenZ</a></i> and <i><a href=\"/wiki/The_Last_Starfighter\" title=\"The Last Starfighter\">The Last Starfighter</a></i>.</p> <p>Ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. They argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. <a href=\"/wiki/Espen_J._Aarseth\" title=\"Espen J. Aarseth\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Espen J. Aarseth</a> argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. For example, Aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tomb_Raider\" title=\"Tomb Raider\">Tomb Raider</a></i>, saying that \"the dimensions of <a href=\"/wiki/Lara_Croft\" title=\"Lara Croft\">Lara Croft</a>'s body, already analyzed to death by <a href=\"/wiki/Film_theory\" title=\"Film theory\">film theorists</a>, are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... When I play, I don't even see her body, but see through it and past it.\" Simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.</p> <p>While many games rely on <a href=\"/wiki/Emergence\" title=\"Emergence\">emergent principles</a>, video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game. The term \"emergent narrative\" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by \"what happens to the player.\" However, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. In general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for <a href=\"/wiki/Artificial_Intelligence\" title=\"Artificial Intelligence\" class=\"mw-redirect\">AI</a> in a game, emergent behavior will exist. For instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. The programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_aspects\">Social aspects</span></h2> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Demographics\">Demographics</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Women_and_video_games\" title=\"Women and video games\">Women and video games</a></div> <p>The November 2005 Nielsen Active Gamer Study, taking a survey of 2,000 regular <a href=\"/wiki/Gamer\" title=\"Gamer\">gamers</a>, found that the U.S. games market is diversifying. The age group among male players has expanded significantly in the 25–40 age group. For casual online puzzle-style and simple mobile cell phone games, the gender divide is more or less equal between males and females. Females have also been found to show an attraction to online multi-player games where there is a communal experience. More recently there has been a growing segment of female players engaged with the aggressive style of games historically considered to fall within traditionally male genres (e.g., <a href=\"/wiki/First-person_shooter\" title=\"First-person shooter\">first-person shooters</a>). According to the ESRB almost 41% of PC gamers are women</p> <p>When comparing today's industry climate with that of 20 years ago, women and many adults are more inclined to be using products in the industry. While the market for teen and young adult men is still a strong market, it is the other demographics which are posting significant growth. The <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Association\" title=\"Entertainment Software Association\">Entertainment Software Association</a> (ESA) provides the following summary for 2011 based on a study of almost 1,200 American households carried out by Ipsos MediaCT:</p> <ul> <li>The average gamer is 30 years old and has been playing for 12 years. Eighty-two percent of gamers are 18 years of age or older.</li> <li>Forty-two percent of all players are women and women over 18 years of age are one of the industry's fastest growing demographics.</li> <li>Today, adult women represent a greater portion of the game-playing population (37 percent) than boys age 17 or younger (13 percent).</li> <li>Twenty-nine percent of game players are over the age of 50, an increase from nine percent in 1999.</li> <li>Sixty-five percent of gamers play games with other gamers in person.</li> <li>Fifty-five percent of gamers play games on their phones or handheld device.</li> </ul> <p>A 2006 academic study, based on a survey answered by 10,000 gamers, identified the <a href=\"/wiki/Gaymer\" title=\"Gaymer\">gaymers</a> (gamers that identify as gay) as a demographic group. A follow-up survey in 2009 studied the purchase habits and content preferences of people in the group.</p> <p>Based on the study by NPD group in 2011, approximately 91 percent of children aged 2–17 play games.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Multiplayer\">Multiplayer</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Multiplayer_video_game\" title=\"Multiplayer video game\">Multiplayer video game</a></div> <p>Video gaming has traditionally been a social experience. <a href=\"/wiki/Multiplayer_game\" title=\"Multiplayer game\">Multiplayer video games</a> are those that can be played either competitively, sometimes in <a href=\"/wiki/Electronic_Sports\" title=\"Electronic Sports\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Electronic Sports</a>, or cooperatively by using either multiple input devices, or by <a href=\"/wiki/Hotseat_(multiplayer_mode)\" title=\"Hotseat (multiplayer mode)\">hotseating</a>. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Tennis_for_Two\" title=\"Tennis for Two\">Tennis for Two</a></i>, arguably the first video game, was a two player game, as was its successor <i><a href=\"/wiki/Pong\" title=\"Pong\">Pong</a></i>. The first commercially available game console, the <a href=\"/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey\" title=\"Magnavox Odyssey\">Magnavox Odyssey</a>, had two controller inputs.</p> <p>Since then, most consoles have been shipped with two or four controller inputs. Some have had the ability to expand to four, eight or as many as 12 inputs with additional adapters, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Multitap\" title=\"Multitap\">Multitap</a>. Multiplayer <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade games</a> typically feature play for two to four players, sometimes tilting the monitor on its back for a top-down viewing experience allowing players to sit opposite one another.</p> <p>Many early computer games for non-PC descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support. Personal computer systems from <a href=\"/wiki/Atari\" title=\"Atari\">Atari</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Commodore_International\" title=\"Commodore International\">Commodore</a> both regularly featured at least two game ports. PC-based computer games started with a lower availability of multiplayer options because of technical limitations. PCs typically had either one or no game ports at all. Network games for these early personal computers were generally limited to only text based adventures or <a href=\"/wiki/MUD\" title=\"MUD\">MUDs</a> that were played remotely on a dedicated server. This was due both to the slow speed of modems (300-1200-bit/s), and the prohibitive cost involved with putting a computer online in such a way where multiple visitors could make use of it. However, with the advent of widespread <a href=\"/wiki/Local_area_network\" title=\"Local area network\">local area networking</a> technologies and Internet based online capabilities, the number of players in modern games can be 32 or higher, sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat. <a href=\"/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game\" title=\"Massively multiplayer online game\">MMOs</a> can offer extremely high numbers of simultaneous players; <i><a href=\"/wiki/Eve_Online\" title=\"Eve Online\">Eve Online</a></i> set a record with 65,303 players on a single server in 2013.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Behavioral_effects\">Behavioral effects</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_behavioral_effects\" title=\"Video game behavioral effects\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Video game behavioral effects</a></div> <p>It has been shown that action video game players have better <a href=\"/wiki/Hand%E2%80%93eye_coordination\" title=\"Hand–eye coordination\" class=\"mw-redirect\">hand–eye coordination</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Motor_coordination\" title=\"Motor coordination\">visuo-motor skills</a>, such as their resistance to <a href=\"/wiki/Distraction\" title=\"Distraction\">distraction</a>, their sensitivity to information in the <a href=\"/wiki/Peripheral_vision\" title=\"Peripheral vision\">peripheral vision</a> and their ability to count briefly presented objects, than nonplayers.</p> <p>Researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games, involving challenges that switch attention between different locations, but not with games requiring concentration on single objects. It has been suggested by a few studies that online/offline video gaming can be used as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of different mental health concerns.</p> <p>In <a href=\"/wiki/Steven_Berlin_Johnson\" title=\"Steven Berlin Johnson\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Steven Johnson</a>'s book, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Everything_Bad_Is_Good_for_You\" title=\"Everything Bad Is Good for You\">Everything Bad Is Good for You</a></i>, he argues that video games in fact demand far more from a player than traditional games like <i><a href=\"/wiki/Monopoly_(game)\" title=\"Monopoly (game)\">Monopoly</a></i>. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, as well as how to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the human-machine interface works, including menus and <a href=\"/wiki/HUD_(computer_gaming)\" title=\"HUD (computer gaming)\" class=\"mw-redirect\">HUDs</a>. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.</p> <p>Learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the U.S. education system. It has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits. Students are found to be \"learning by doing\" while playing video games while fostering creative thinking.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/United_States_Army\" title=\"United States Army\">U.S. Army</a> has deployed machines such as the <a href=\"/wiki/PackBot\" title=\"PackBot\">PackBot</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/UAV\" title=\"UAV\" class=\"mw-redirect\">UAV</a> vehicles, which make use of a game-style <a href=\"/wiki/Game_controller\" title=\"Game controller\">hand controller</a> to make it more familiar for young people.</p> <p>According to research discussed at the 2008 Convention of the American Psychological Association, certain types of video games can improve the gamers' <a href=\"/wiki/Dexterity\" title=\"Dexterity\" class=\"mw-redirect\">dexterity</a> as well as their ability to problem-solve. A study of 33 laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were 27 percent faster at advanced surgical procedures and made 37 percent fewer errors compared to those who did not play video games. A second study of 303 laparoscopic surgeons (82 percent men; 18 percent women) also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills and hand dexterity and then performed a drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt and across all 10 trials than the surgeons who did not play the video games first.</p> <p>The research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due to methodological shortcomings, such as recruitment strategies and selection bias, potential placebo effects, and lack of baseline improvements in control groups. In addition, many of the studies are <a href=\"/wiki/Cross-sectional\" title=\"Cross-sectional\" class=\"mw-redirect\">cross-sectional</a>, and of the <a href=\"/wiki/Longitudinal_study\" title=\"Longitudinal study\">longitudinal</a> interventional trials, not all have found effects. A response to this pointed out that the skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted, such as mental rotation, which is not a common task in action games.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Controversy\">Controversy</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote relarticle mainarticle\">Main article: <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_controversy\" title=\"Video game controversy\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Video game controversy</a></div> <p>Like related forms of media, computer and video games have been the subject of frequent controversy and censorship, due to the depiction of graphic violence, <a href=\"/wiki/Sex\" title=\"Sex\">sexual themes</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Advergaming\" title=\"Advergaming\" class=\"mw-redirect\">advertisement</a>, consumption of <a href=\"/wiki/Recreational_drug_use\" title=\"Recreational drug use\">drugs</a>, consumption of <a href=\"/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage\" title=\"Alcoholic beverage\">alcohol</a> or <a href=\"/wiki/Tobacco\" title=\"Tobacco\">tobacco</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Propaganda\" title=\"Propaganda\">propaganda</a>, or <a href=\"/wiki/Profanity\" title=\"Profanity\">profanity</a> in some games. Among others, critics of video games often include parents' groups, politicians, organized religious groups, and other <a href=\"/wiki/Advocacy_group\" title=\"Advocacy group\">advocacy groups</a>. Various games have been accused of causing <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_addiction\" title=\"Video game addiction\">addiction</a> and even violent behavior, though how much ground this holds is debatable. \"Video game censorship\" is defined as the use of state or group power to control the playing, distribution, purchase, or sale of video games or computer games. Video game controversy comes in many forms, and censorship is a controversial subject. Proponents and opponents of censorship are often very passionate about their individual views. However, there has not been substantial evidence against or in favor of showing a positive correlation between video games and acts such as killing.</p> <p>Various national content rating organizations, such as the <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) in North America, rate software for certain age groups and with certain content warnings. Some of these organizations are optional industry self-regulation (such as the ESRB), while others are part of national government censorship organizations (such as the <a href=\"/wiki/BBFC\" title=\"BBFC\" class=\"mw-redirect\">BBFC</a>). Most video games display their rating on the front side of their packaging. However, parents are not always aware of the existence of these ratings. Not all ratings are considered accurate. Organizations such as <i>What They Play</i> and <i>Common Sense Media</i> aim to provide guidance and advice for parents.</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ratings_and_censorship\">Ratings and censorship</span></h2> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ESRB\">ESRB</span></h3> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a> (ESRB) gives video games maturity ratings based on their content. For example, a game might be rated <i>T</i> for <i>Teen</i> if the game contained obscene words or violence. If a game contains explicit violence or sexual themes, it is likely to receive an <i>M</i> for <i>Mature</i> rating, which means that no one under 17 should play it. There is a rated \"A/O\" games for \"Adults Only\" these games have massive violence or nudity. There are no laws that prohibit children from purchasing \"M\" rated games in the United States. Laws attempting to prohibit minors from purchasing \"M\" rated games were established in California, <a href=\"/wiki/Illinois\" title=\"Illinois\">Illinois</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Michigan\" title=\"Michigan\">Michigan</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/Minnesota\" title=\"Minnesota\">Minnesota</a>, and <a href=\"/wiki/Louisiana\" title=\"Louisiana\">Louisiana</a>, but all were overturned on the grounds that these laws violated the First Amendment. However, many stores have opted to not sell such games to children anyway. Of course, video game laws vary from country to country. One of the most controversial games of all time, <i><a href=\"/wiki/Manhunt_2\" title=\"Manhunt 2\">Manhunt 2</a></i> by Rockstar Studios, was given an <a href=\"/wiki/Entertainment_Software_Rating_Board#Restricted_ratings\" title=\"Entertainment Software Rating Board\">AO rating</a> by the ESRB until Rockstar could make the content more suitable for a mature audience.</p> <p>Video game manufacturers usually exercise tight control over the games that are made available on their systems, so unusual or special-interest games are more likely to appear as <a href=\"/wiki/PC_games\" title=\"PC games\" class=\"mw-redirect\">PC games</a>. Free, casual, and <a href=\"/wiki/Browser-based_game\" title=\"Browser-based game\" class=\"mw-redirect\">browser-based games</a> are usually played on available computers, mobile phones, or <a href=\"/wiki/Personal_digital_assistant\" title=\"Personal digital assistant\">PDAs</a>.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"PEGI\">PEGI</span></h3> <p><a href=\"/wiki/Pan_European_Game_Information\" title=\"Pan European Game Information\">Pan European Game Information</a> (PEGI) is a system that was developed to standardize the game ratings in all of Europe (not just <a href=\"/wiki/European_Union\" title=\"European Union\">European Union</a>, although the majority are EU members), the current members are: all EU members, except Germany and the 10 accession states; <a href=\"/wiki/Norway\" title=\"Norway\">Norway</a>; <a href=\"/wiki/Switzerland\" title=\"Switzerland\">Switzerland</a>. Iceland is expected to join soon, as are the 10 EU accession states. For all PEGI members, they use it as their sole system, with the exception of the UK, where if a game contains certain material, it must be rated by <a href=\"/wiki/British_Board_of_Film_Classification\" title=\"British Board of Film Classification\">BBFC</a>. The PEGI ratings are legally binding in Vienna and it is a criminal offence to sell a game to someone if it is rated above their age.</p> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Germany:_BPjM_and_USK\">Germany: BPjM and USK</span></h3> <p>Stricter game rating laws mean that Germany does not operate within the PEGI. Instead, they adopt their own system of certification which is required by law. The <a href=\"/wiki/Unterhaltungssoftware_Selbstkontrolle\" title=\"Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle\">Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle</a> (<i>USK</i> or Voluntary Certification of Entertainment Software) checks every game before release and assigns an age rating to it – either none (white), 6 years of age (yellow), 12 years of age (green), 16 years of age (blue) or 18 years of age (red). It is forbidden for anyone, retailers, friends or parents alike, to allow a child access to a game for which he or she is underage. If a game is particularly violent, it may be referred to the BPjM (<i><a href=\"/wiki/Bundespr%C3%BCfstelle_f%C3%BCr_jugendgef%C3%A4hrdende_Medien\" title=\"Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Bundesprüfstelle für jugendgefährdende Medien</a></i> – Federal Verification Office for Child-Endangering Media) who may opt to place it on the <i>Index</i> upon which the game may not be sold openly or advertised in the open media. Unofficially, the titles are not \"banned\" – adult gamers are still technically free to obtain the titles by other means, although it is still considered a felony to supply these titles to a child</p> <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Commercial_aspects\">Commercial aspects</span></h2> <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Game_sales\">Game sales</span></h3> <div class=\"hatnote boilerplate seealso\">See also: <a href=\"/wiki/Video_game_industry\" title=\"Video game industry\">Video game industry</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games\" title=\"List of best-selling video games\">List of best-selling video games</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_age_of_arcade_video_games\" title=\"Golden age of arcade video games\">Golden age of arcade video games</a></div> <p>The four largest producers of and markets for computer and video games (in order) are North America (US and Canada), Japan, the United Kingdom and <a href=\"/wiki/Video_gaming_in_Germany\" title=\"Video gaming in Germany\">Germany</a>.

Irish are the largest per capita consumers of video games.</p> <p>Sales of different types of games vary widely between these markets due to local preferences. Japanese consumers tend to purchase much more <a href=\"/wiki/Console_game\" title=\"Console game\">console games</a> than <a href=\"/wiki/PC_game\" title=\"PC game\">computer games</a>, with a strong preference for games catering to local tastes. Another key difference is that, despite the decline of arcades in the Western world (see <a href=\"/wiki/Golden_age_of_video_arcade_games\" title=\"Golden age of video arcade games\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Golden age of video arcade games</a>), <a href=\"/wiki/Arcade_game\" title=\"Arcade game\">arcade games</a> remain the largest sector of the <a href=\"/wiki/Video_gaming_in_Japan\" title=\"Video gaming in Japan\">Japanese gaming industry</a>.

There are over 20,000 <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_caf%C3%A9\" title=\"Internet café\">Internet cafés</a> in South Korea where computer games can be played for an hourly charge. Computer games are also popular in China, which has a PC gaming industry worth $6 billion, the largest in the world. Arcade games are also still a thriving <a href=\"/wiki/Video_gaming_in_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China\" title=\"Video gaming in the People's Republic of China\" class=\"mw-redirect\">industry in China</a>, though console games have been banned in the country since the early 2000s.</p> <p>The <a href=\"/wiki/NPD_Group\" title=\"NPD Group\">NPD Group</a> tracks computer and video game sales in the United States.

Another growing factor that is difficult to account for is the expansion and popularity of <a href=\"/wiki/Indie_games\" title=\"Indie games\" class=\"mw-redirect\">independent games</a>, which typically bypass traditional developer/publisher relationships to instead market directly to the consumer.</p> <p>These figures are sales in dollars, not units, Unit shipments for each category were higher than the dollar sales numbers indicate, because more software and hardware was discounted than in 2003. But with the release of the next-generation consoles in 2006, these numbers increased dramatically. The game and film industries are also becoming increasingly intertwined, with companies like <a href=\"/wiki/Sony\" title=\"Sony\">Sony</a> having significant stakes in both. A large number of summer blockbuster films spawn a companion game, often launching at the same time to share the marketing costs.</p> <p>The global market for console games has seen an average of 6.9 percent compound annual growth rate and is expected to become a $34.7 billion market in 2012.Online game sales are expected to grow at a larger rate of 16.9 percent, escalating from $6.6 billion in 2008 to $14.4 billion by 2012.
